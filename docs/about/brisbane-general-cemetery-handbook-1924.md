# The Brisbane General Cemetery.

## A City of Natural Beauty

It would seem that Nature designed Brisbane, the metropolis of Queensland, to be the most beautiful river‑city in the world. Its contour site and surroundings certainly make it one of the most picturesque capitals in the Southern Hemisphere. Twenty miles of a noble winding river from Oxley to Pinkenba; the well-defined inner suburbs crowded with attractive residences; the rapidly expanding environs spreading over countless charming slopes marked by spacious roads and decorated with handsome villas; the City itself humming with traffic and business and far outgrowing the early plans of its founders; the hills and dales, parks and squares, imperial spires and substantially built warehouses, broad river‑reaches and stately ocean liners — all enter into a succession of magnificent pictures that are photographed on the observant mind as a joy for ever.

Brisbane's old cemetery used to be situated in the once restful hollow between Petrie Terrace and Paddington Hill. There in that now almost forgotten God's acre sleep many who saw the struggling scattered settlement at Moreton Bay in the 'fifties, 'sixties, and 'seventies. A pathetic interest attaches to the spot. As Brisbane grew, this old cemetery soon became full. With the selection of new burial grounds and the passing of years the place suffered from neglect. Fences fell down and a few unkempt paths, voiceless mounds, and weathered and leaning headstones with short inscriptions scarcely decipherable, were all that was left to record the passing of many a sturdy pioneer and worthy citizen. In quite recent years the land on the left of the Paddington tramline has been transformed into a sports oval; while the opposite side has been metamorphosed into a children's recreation ground, and what the poet Gordon wished has been almost realised in cold fact:

> "Let me slumber in the hollow where the wattle blossoms wave, <br>
> With never stone or rail to fence my bed; <br>
> Should the sturdy station children pull the bush flowers on my grave, <br>
> I may chance to hear them romping overhead."

<br>


> "I shall pass this way but once. If therefore there be any kindness I can show, or any good thing I can do, let me do it now; let me not defer it nor neglect it, for I shall not pass this way again." — Stephen Grellett.

When the Paddington Cemetery was removed, a special Act of Parliament was passed which enabled the Trustees to make arrangements by which, on the application of relatives, the remains of persons long deceased were exhumed from the old Cemetery and re‑buried in the new, and the old headstones were also cleaned, re‑lettered, and removed free of expense to present relatives.

The Brisbane General Cemetery includes an area of approximately 122½ acres and is situated at Toowong, about 4½ miles from the General Post Office. It is easily reached by tram, train or motor car. The original area of the reserve was 248 acres 3 roods 22 perches. Of this an area of 40 acres was at first definitely set aside and fenced for cemetery purposes. Toowong Park Act of 1915 the Legislature enabled and authorised the Trustees to transfer 132 acres to the Toowong Town Council for park purposes, the proceeds of the transfer being devoted to the erection of Cemetery wall, iron railings and gates. By the purchase and enclosure of 6½ acres of other land the Trustees were enabled to ensure that the total area of the Cemetery was completely surrounded by public roads.

Except for its nearness to the fast spreading city no better ground for variety of contour, accessibility, convenience of area, and excellence of drainage could have been chosen for the General Cemetery than the site at Toowong. Oversea visitors frequently admire the natural beauty of its
position and describe it as one of the prettiest cemeteries in the world. A frequent tram service (3d. from the city) runs past the grounds and the gates are but a ten minutes' walk from the Toowong Railway Station. Here in many a height and hollow sleep the remains of Brisbane's silent hundreds. The extensive grounds are well planned out and are gradually being transformed into a scene of beauty in keeping with the associations and purposes of the Trust. Monuments of past Governors of Queensland and of distinguished citizens tower amid the thousands of humbler stones that rise from the flowered slopes. The development of the Cemetery area can only be made slowly as there is no endowment to the Trust, and the steady policy of the Trustees is to keep the Cemetery fees and charges as reasonable as possible in the public interest. The annual margin of credit is not large, but with judicious management the Trustees are able to carry out gradually a well defined plan of improvement.

## Other Cemeteries.

South Brisbane Cemetery, Boggo Road.— Gladstone Road tram from North Quay to Cemetery gates (3d. fare). A picturesque spot — the broad winding river flowing at one's feet on to the eternal sea, the stretches of fertile land in the green pockets, the city spreading from amid the trees, and on the blue horizon the soaring peaks of God. One hardly knows which is <!--

> And, the voyage o'er, death is the quiet haven of us all." — Wordsworth.

the prettier view — the river from the Cemetery, or the green slopes dotted with their silent stones of white viewed from the river. No new ground is now available in this Cemetery, the only burials taking place being those where graves are reopened. An extensive area of land for a new Cemetery is held by the Trustees at Mt. Gravatt.

Morningside (or Balmoral) Cemetery, Bulimba. — Train from Melbourne Street Station or 3d. tram from Queen Street to Norman Park with ten minutes walk over Galloway's Hill. A comparatively new Cemetery,
it already has many beautiful graves. The summit of the hill commands
a view of the city so extensive and varied that one might almost fancy the departed could from their last resting place view the Land that is not far off, and gaze on the hills called Beautiful.

Other Cemeteries are laid out at Lutwyche (Kedron Park tram), Nudgee (Sandgate railway), Nundah (railway), Hemmant (motor), and in some of the older churchyards (following a homeland custom) a God's acre is sometimes found.

## Formation of Trust.

The Act of Parliament "to establish Cemeteries in the colony of Queensland" was assented to on 13th September, 1865, repealing portion of the "Municipal Institutions Act of 1864" and by-laws thereunder.

The Cemetery Trust was established in 1870. The position is purely
honorary, none of the Trustees, not even the Chairman, receiving any allowance whatever.

An original letter (still in the possession of Hon. James Cowlishaw)
marks the genesis of the present Trust:—

> Circular.
> 
> Department of Public Lands,
>
> Brisbane, October 12th, 1870.
> 
> Sir,— I am directed to acquaint you that His Excellency the Governor with the advice of the Executive Council has been pleased to appoint you to be a Trustee of the New Brisbane Cemetery in conjunction with the following gentlemen, John Hardgrave, William Pettigrew, Samuel Walker Griffith, George Edmondstone, Alexander Raff, John Petrie, Michael Quinlan, Nathaniel Lade, and William Perry, Esquires, and I am to suggest that you will have the goodness to take an early opportunity of conferring with the other Members in order that the purposes for which the Trust is appointed may be speedily carried out.
> 
> The notification of the appointments as well as the description of the land which it is proposed to reserve for Cemetery purposes appeared respectively in the Government Gazette of 10th and 8th instants.

The fourth Chairman was George Myers (1906-1919), a Trustee in
July, 1881, who held that post till his death, May 18, 1920. James Stodart, M.L.A., succeeded him and was Chairman till June 20, 1922, the date of his death. The present Chairman is W. D. Grimes, Esq., who has been a Trustee for over twenty-four years.

## Meetings and Extracts from Minutes.

Ordinary meetings of the Trustees are held regularly every month, and additional emergency meetings are held as required. Only twice in fifty‑three years did the meeting lapse for want of a quorum.

On October 10th, 1922, the Trustees held a special meeting at the residence of Hon. Jas. Cowlishaw, M.L.C., to signalise his fifty years honorary service as Public Trustee - a record unique in Australia. On March 6th, 1924, an interesting special meeting was held at the same place, the whole eleven Trustees being present.

Very many interesting names and facts are recorded in the minutes. A
few extracts from these are here given :—

The first meeting of the new Board was held on October 18th, 1870, when John Petrie was appointed Chairman. At the meeting on October 25th, 1870, there were present: John Petrie, William Perry, John Hardgrave,
Nathaniel Lade, Samuel Walker Griffith, William Pettigrew, George Edmondstone, and Alexander Raff.

Search commenced for a suitable site. The first cheques drawn by the Trustees were £2/10/- for "Kerr-cab hire to the ground," and £2/10/- "Hannah-sinking holes."

A Government Cemetery Reserve had been set apart, and in October, 1871, forty acres were chosen to meet "present requirements."

John Ballard': tender for erecting 540 rods of "good pig-proof fencing" was accepted at 20/- a rod.

A Keeper's Lodge was built by E. Lewis, who also erected the gates and ornamental fencing.

Rules and Regulations and a Scale of Charges were drawn up by Messrs. Pettigrew and Griffith (i e., Rt. Hon. Sir S. W. Griffith, afterwards Chief Justice of the Commonwealth).

John Hannah was put in possession of the cottage at a salary of £2/2/- a week.

Portions of the Cemetery were set apart in March, 1875, for Church of England, Hebrew, and Wesleyan denominations; and later for St. Paul's Free Church of England and Ireland, Methodist Connexion, Roman Catholic Church, and New Jerusalem Church.

In 1875 plans were prepared by the Surveyor-General and a proper set of books from Government Printer.

A £10 honorarium was given to Mr. Rawlin for acting as Secretary during 1874.

The Cemetery was officially opened 5th July, 1875.

A permanent Secretary soon became necessary, and Henry J. Oxley, of Queen Street, was selected from eighteen applications.

J. Melville, on 17th August, 1875, was designated as Overseer in charge.

On July 11th, 1875, the Acclimatisation Society gave fifty trees for planting in the Cemetery.

The deed of grant of Cemetery lands was received April, 1877.

In 1877, Parliament appointed a committee to enquire whether the Cemetery was a suitable place for interment.

The gardens began to be tended by a "dresser" in 1878. Later, Wm. Melville was appointed to the work.

In February, 1879, E. Bishop secured the tender for a three roomed cottage at £108.

The Cemetery was opened for interment on Sundays, 6 to 8 a.m. and 3 to 5 p.m, in January, 1881.

A telephone was installed 1882.

The rules and regulations were amended in 1882.

The number of interments for year 1883 was 916.

For many years a donation was given to the Acclimatisation Society and to Brisbane General Hospital.

A pavilion was erected in 1885.

A public Meeting was held at Toowong, July 16th, 1885, to discuss the closing of the Cemetery at Toowong.

The Secretary then stated that the value of private graves would be
about 65000, and of headstones about $25,000. The Secretary then stated the value of the private graves would be about £5000, and of headstones £25,000.

In August, 1885, there was a proposal for a new cemetery at Goodna. On 24th September, 1885, a party visited Woolston to inspect the proposed site.

Mr. Robert Lindsay was auditor during 1884—1889; Mr. Blakeston Robinson held the office 1889—1917; and Mr. Walter E. Savage from 1917 to date.

On April 27th, 1886, a request from the Colonial Secretary's Office for a reserve for interment of men of the A Battery dying during term of service with the colours was granted.

On 14th October, 1886, a party visited the Rifle Butts at Woolston to consider a site as suitable for a Cemetery. Reported as unsuitable. Later a Reserve was set aside by the Government, and in 1889 thirteen Trustees of it were appointed. It was arranged in June, 1887, that part of land to left of road be used as Rifle Range, the Colonial Secretary paying £15 a year nominal rent for it.

A new cottage was built at cost of £250.

In 1901 it was estimated that there was room in the present portion of Toowong Cemetery (taking the other metropolitan cemeteries into account) for the needs of Brisbane for the next fifty years, and if the portion used for Rifle Butts were included the needs for one hundred years would be adequately met.

For years there was an agitation for a railway loop line to the Cemetery gates. Political promises were made, but the coming of the trams soon after 1901 rendered the railway unnecessary.

The extension of the cars also contributed to the postponement of any scheme for opening up a new cemetery at Woolston.

Early in 1903 the Toowong Town Council proposed the closing the Cemetery.

On Sunday, July 24th, 1904, so great a crowd was in attendance at the unveiling of Spragg's memorial that damage was done to surrounding graves. When Hon. William Henry Browne's memorial was unveiled on April 30th, 1905, a squad of twelve police were present to protect the surrounding railings and tombstones.

In December, 1907, a Sectional Register from earliest records to date was made at a cost of £50.

Considerable improvements to the grounds were effected in 1908; fences and out-buildings were repaired, and trees removed.

Fees were increased as in Government Gazette of December 25th, 1909.

New Rules and Regulations appeared in Government Gazette of 4th April, 1910.

In 1913 *The Cremation Act* came into force, but has so far proved inoperative. A Cremation Society of Brisbane had conference with Trustees, and negotiations were carried on, and a choice of three sites had been offered. No cremating has yet taken place in Queensland. No Crematorium has yet been established.

In 1914 the Trustees consented to the transfer of part of their ground, known as the Old Rifle Range, to the Toowong Town Council, for the sum of £1000 and the right to obtain top-dressing materials from a specified area.
The land was originally 257 acres; 8 were needed for streets, 100 were utilised as cemetery, 15 were used as sites for cottages and offices, and 134 was known as the Rifle Range. The Toowong Park Act was passed on
November 15th, 1915. Shortly afterwards the money was paid and the transfer was effected.

In April, 1916, the Trustees purchased 6½ acres contiguous to the present grounds at £30 an acre, thus completing a convenient cemetery acreage, entirely surrounded by public roads.

In 1916 the Brisbane Tramways Company Ltd. erected a shelter shed.

New Rules and Regulations were gazetted 9th January, 1917.

The Stone of Remembrance was unveiled by His Excellency the Governor-General of the Commonwealth on Anzac Day (April 25th), 1924. witnessed by a large multitude. It was a most impressive ceremony, the land on which the Cross of Sacrifice and Stone of Remembrance are erected is one of the most conspicuous and picturesque spots in the Cemetery, and was donated by the Trustees to the Anzac Memorial Committee. (Photo p. 10)

The new building was completed in 1924

The Trustees' policy throughout has been to keep down all fees and charges to a reasonable scale compatible with the growth of the city, the desire for extensions, and the need for gradual improvements. A very useful building has now been erected (see photo. page 4) making provision for Cemetery office, tool room and lockers, lavatories, retiring rooms, dining room with gas jet, shower, etc., for convenience of the staff.

Included in the plans for future development (when finances allow) is the erection of a mortuary chapel, a possible crematorium, the erection of more suitable walls, fencing and entrances, the planting of trees, and an extension of the system by which in return for the payment of a lump sum the Trustees undertake the upkeep and tendance of any grave.

## Garden 

For some years the cultivation of flowers within the Cemetery grounds has been a special feature. This provision by the Trustees is much appreciated by the public. Flowers, shrubs and plants may be obtained at any time during the working hours of the Cemetery at a moderate charge. This branch of the activities has been created to meet the needs of relatives and friends visiting the graves of the departed, and often on holidays and Sundays the demand for flowers has been greater than the supply. The Trustees also undertake, besides the filling and tending, etc., of enclosures, the obligation of placing flowers on graves for any stated time or period, at a fee which can be mutually arranged.

----

<!--  18 -->

## Planting of Trees.

For twenty years prior to 1902 many plants and young trees were supplied from the Acclimatisation Society's gardens. As these have grown they have added to the health and beauty of the grounds.

In February, 1905, the old dam, that used to be in the Cemetery, was emptied as being no longer required on account of the water taps now placed at various points in the Cemetery.

## Attendance to Graves.

The lowest amount now accepted to enable a grave to be attended to in perpetuity is £50. These amounts are paid into a Trust Fund (over £1200 has been already received for this purpose) and a formal agreement is made between the Trustees and the relatives or parties who provide the money. The interest on this money is devoted solely to the purposes of the Trust, and in this way the Trustees are enabled to keep the enclosure perpetually in good order, attending to the monument, and stone coping and railings whenever necessary, and re-lettering and painting whenever desirable.

## The Staff.

The overseer is John L. Melville, the assistant overseer is F. Lloyd, and among the efficient and contented staff of twenty-one men are several who have been in the employ of the Trustees for over fifteen years.

## Accidents.

The staff are now all insured under the Workers Compensation Act.
The first payment of £16 10s. was for the year 1906 when the wages
were £1650, but as only one accident had occurred in the previous 32 years (when the overseer was helping some one outside his duties) the Trustees then decided to carry their own risks. Later the Trustees insured all employees under the Act.

## Cemetery Hours.

For funerals and visitation, see Rules appended hereto. As in most cities the favourite time for visitors is Sunday afternoon, and the setting sun sheds its rays softly on floral tributes that deck hundreds of graves and tell of a love that many winters cannot efface. Not a day passes but what graves


>" Life! we've been long together
>Through pleasant and through cloudy weather ;.


> "Tis hard to part when friends are dear,-Perhaps 'twill cost a sigh, a tear;
> Then steal away, give little warning,
> Choose thine own time;
> Say not 'Good-night,' but in some brighter clime
> Bid me 'Good-morning'" — Mrs, Barkauld,

----

<!-- 19 -->

are visited and evidences left of renewed affection and care. Admission is free and unrestricted to any section, and the overseer or any of the staff will be glad to afford any information on the position of old or present graves. All that is required is that visitors shall conduct themselves circumspectly, and walk along the paths without destroying or injuring any of the flowers or mementoes or headstones, and without stepping over any of the graves. For visitors the Cemetery is open from 6 a.m.- 6 p.m. For funerals the hours are 8 am to 6 p.m.from September to April, and from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. from May to August. Further detailed information is found in the Rules printed herewith.

## Sunday Funerals.

The undertakers decided that after April 1st, 1903, no funerals would be conducted on Sundays. A few months afterwards two of the undertakers notified that they would conduct funerals on Sundays if necessary. The Council of Churches disapproved of Sunday funerals. The Cemetery By-Laws allowed them between 8-9 a.m. and 2-5 p.m. The Trustees allowed the By-Laws to stand. There were only five funerals on Sundays from 5th April, 1903, to 26th March, 1905. The present hours are 8-9 a.m. only, unless a special permit is granted by the Trustees.

The Great Reaper reaps the bearded grain as well as " the flowers that grow between, " and all ages are represented in the graves, from the infant who perchance never opened its eyes to the great grandfather who has seen a hundred summers come and go. Centenarians buried at Toowong include the following records: —


|--:|:--|:--|
| July 4, 1894  | Margaret Jane Brennan | 103 years 5 months |
| March 10, 1900 | Michael Ryan | 101 years |
|  Oct. 18, 1908  | Catherine Jacobs | 103 years |
| Jan. 1O, 1920 | Thomas Taylor | 103 years  |
| June 5, 1922 | Jas. O'Brien | 100 years |

(It is, perhaps, always well to remember in connection with this question that while parish registers in the United Kingdom and elsewhere often date very far back, compulsory registration of births date practically only from 1874, the Act of 1836 having proved very defective).
