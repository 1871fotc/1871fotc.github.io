# Toowong Cemetery Road Signs and Names

Some Toowong Cemetery road signs need to be replaced or repaired:

- some signs have not been updated to reflect road name changes.
- some signs are unreadable due to weathering.
- some signs have been bent or moved down the post by vandals. 
  
Additional road signs could be added to make wayfinding in the cemetery easier.

The 4 maps on display at the cemetery enteries and the Shelter Shed at the start of Federation Drive have not been updated to reflect the new road names.
