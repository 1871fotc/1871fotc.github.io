!!! question "Volunteer - report a damaged sign"

    Unfortunately signs are often vandalised in the cemetery. **[Contact us](../contact.md)** if you find a damaged sign.

- An image, if available, is on the right of the text and masked in an oval.
- The right edge of the text should follow the curve of the oval image.
