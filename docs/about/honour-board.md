# Toowong Cemetery Honour Board

Friends of Toowong Cemetery are planning to erect an honour board at the cemetery's main entrance to commemorate people who have served their nation in military uniform and now rest in Toowong Cemetery. 

We've found over 5,500 men and women that have earnt a place on the honour board.
