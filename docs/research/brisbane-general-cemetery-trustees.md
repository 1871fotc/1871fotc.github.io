## Help identify the trustees in this photo

Our guess by comparing it to the 1924 photo below:

- Top insets: [James Cowlishaw](james-cowlishaw.md), [Andrew L. Petrie](andrew-lang-petrie.md)
- Standing:  ==unknown 1==, John McDonald, Charles H. Harley, E. Griffith Oxley, ==Edward M. Myers?==
- Seated: [James William Wassell](james-william-wassell.md), ==unknown 2==, ==unknown 3==
- Bottom insets: ==J. A. Hayes?==, ==E. W. H. Fowles?==

Using other photos, we believe:

- ==unknown 1== is [W. D. Grimes](https://onesearch.slq.qld.gov.au/permalink/61SLQ_INST/dls06p/alma99183506003302061)
- ==unknown 2== is [James Stodart](https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/192979671?searchTerm=James%20Stodart). He was Chairman **25/2/1919** - 20/6/1922. His location in the photo would indicate he was Chairman at the time. 
- ==unknown 3== is [George Frederick Scott](https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/20657005?searchTerm=George%20Frederick%20Scott)

Assuming our guesses above are correct, and using the dates Trustees served from the table below, the photo was taken between **1915 and 20/6/1922**. 

- James Cowlishaw, 1870 - 1929
- Andrew L. Petrie, 1893 - 1928
- W. D. Grimes, ca. 1900 - 1930
- John McDonald, 1904 - 1928
- Charles H. Harley, **1915** - 1930
- E. Griffith Oxley, 1907 - 1930
- James W. Wassell, 1907 - 1924+
- James Stodart, 1907 - **20/6/1922** (replaced by R. M. Stodart, 8/7/1922 - Notice the resemblance.) 
- George Frederick Scott - 1919 or earlier - 29/9/1923 (replaced by W. R. Scott on 17/11/1923)

If we're correct about James Stodart being Chairman at the time, then the photo was taken between **25/2/1919** and 20/6/1922

If we're correct about Edward M. Myers (Trustee **9/7/1920** - 1/4/1926) then the photo was taken between **9/7/1920** - 20/6/1922. The remaining unidentified trustees that served at this time were:

- ==J. A. Hayes==, 16/11/1907 - 1/8/1930 
- ==[E. W. H. Fowles](https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/97672354?searchTerm=Edwin%20Wesley%20Howard%20Fowles)==, 11/12/1914 - 1/8/1930, increasing our confidence about the bottom insets in the photo.
