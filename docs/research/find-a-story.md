    - Sort the table by clicking a column name.
    - The Last Name links to the person's story which may include information beyond what is shown in the self-guided walk. Not everyone has link to their own page yet.
    - Also known as names are shown in *italics* in brackets. 
    - Dates are formatted as yyyy-mm-dd (year, month, day) to help with sorting. Where a year, month or day is unknown, a placeholder value of "yyyy", "mm", or "dd" is used.
    - Location is in the Portion-Section-Grave format.
        - Where a Grave number is unknown, a placeholder value of "gg" is used.

!!! warning "Excel does not process dates correctly"

    If you open the .csv file using Microsoft Excel, be aware that it tries to be helpful and automatically adjust the date formats. It doesn't do this well and can corrupt dates. It also doesn't handle characters like "uÌˆ" very well. We suggest you consider using another tool.
