The [Toowong History Group](http://www.toowong.org.au/home.htm) was formed to celebrate the 100^th^ anniversary of the short‑lived Toowong Town (1903 – 1925) and to record some local memories before they were lost with the passing of generations. 

Their work has resulted in set of three books full of local history. 

1. Toowong: A Community’s History
2. Toowong: Tales of Toowong and early Brisbane
3. Toowong: 1863 – 2011
