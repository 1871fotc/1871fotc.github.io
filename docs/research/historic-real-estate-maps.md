# Historic Real-Estate Maps of Toowong

The maps of Toowong and surrounding areas below are from 1861 to 1936. Some maps show *Government Road* - this is a placeholder name for the road.

In the 1930s the Council decided to rename many streets in Brisbane to make their names unique. The names listed below are the names shown on the maps and may not be the street names in use today. For example:

- *Church Street* was renamed *Jephson Street*, after [Letitia Jephson](../research/letitia-jephson.md).
- *Heussler Terrace*, named after [Johann Christian Heussler](../research/johann-christian-heussler.md), was renamed *Birdwood Terrace*.
- *Third Avenue* off Birdwood Terrace was renamed *Couldrey Street*.
- *River Road* was renamed *Coronation Drive* in honor of the coronation of King George VI.
- *St. Lucia Road* was renamed *Sir Fred Schonell Drive* after the vice-chancellor of the University of Queensland from 1960 to 1969.
