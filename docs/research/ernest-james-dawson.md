# Ernest James Dawson

**ca. 1902 — January 1931**

## Constable Ernest James Dawson <small>(7A‑186‑11)</small> 

On August 6, 1930 Constable Ernest James Dawson was conducting traffic duty on the Yungaburra Road near Lake Barrine when he lost control of his motorcycle and careered off the road.  The 29 year old constable was transported to the Atherton Hospital for an emergency operation to treat internal injuries.  Although the operation was initially successful, Ernest developed pneumonia and further surgery, conducted in Brisbane in January 1931, resulted in the Constable’s death from a haemorrhage.
 
On January 19, 1931 a large funeral procession commenced in Ann Street, Brisbane, with mounted police, uniformed officers and plain clothed detectives marching solemnly in front of and behind the Constable’s flower laden hearse whilst pedestrians watched on respectfully.  Constable Dawson was laid to rest in the Toowong Cemetery with Police Honours.
