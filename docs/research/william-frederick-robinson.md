William was the son of Caroline Wallace and James John Robinson. William and his wife, Sarah, travelled to Australia on the *Royal Dane* from London, arriving in December 1871. On the trip Harry Adams, a cabin steward, stole Sarah's diamond and emerald ring from her second-class cabin. Harry was caught and the ring returned.
