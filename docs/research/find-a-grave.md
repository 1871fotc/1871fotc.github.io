# How to find a grave in Toowong Cemetery

Heritage‑listed Toowong Cemetery is the largest cemetery in Queensland. It can be difficult to find a grave as some graves are unmarked, headstones have been destroyed, and sections are not signed.

## Search for a grave

Use the Brisbane City Council **[Grave location search](https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/community-and-safety/community-support/cemeteries/grave-location-search)** to look up a person's name and find their location in Toowong Cemetery.

Note the location which will be 3 numbers in the format, *Portion*-*Section*-*Grave*. For example, Peter Jackson's grave is located at Portion 5, Section 28, Grave 1, or 5-28-1.

## Grave Markers

Markers can be seen on, or embedded into, graves. They represent a person buried in the grave. Historic Burial and Portion Registers link some people to markers and their grave. Unfortunately many markers are missing or have been moved.

To map a marker to a grave, you need to look up old portion books. For example, Portion 1, Section 1, Grave 38 in the Portion Book page below, maps to Marker ZI 735, which is annotated with the name *"Gale"*. 

Searching for *"Gale"* in the Brisbane City Council **[Grave location search](https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/community-and-safety/community-support/cemeteries/grave-location-search)** you find, by looking at each entry for *"Gale"*, Ruby Mary Gale, who was buried in 1-1-38 on 24 November 1924. You'll also find Ada Florence Morgan buried in 1-1-38 on 11 November 1878 - perhaps this is the B 663 crossed out in the Portion Book. 

Only the surname is recorded in the Portion Book so you can't link a marker to a specific person, although you may be able to imply a link by the order the markers are recorded and the date of each person's death.

## Unmarked Graves

There are many unmarked graves in Toowong Cementery. Take care when you walk across the grass as unmarked graves can leave hidden hollows that are a trip hazard.
