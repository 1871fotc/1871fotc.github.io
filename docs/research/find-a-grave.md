The Friends of Toowong Cemetery can help you find a grave. We can:

  - mark the side of the road with the section number to help you locate the grave when you visit.
  - outline an unmarked grave using a surface spray. The spray does no harm and two mowings later it will disappear.
  - take a digital photograph of a grave and email it to you.

## Grave Markers

Markers can be seen on, or embedded into, graves. They represent a person buried in the grave. A historic Portion Book links some people to markers and their grave. Unfortunately many markers are missing or have been moved.

To map a marker to a grave, you need to look up old portion books. For example, Portion 1, Section 1, Grave 38 in the Portion Book page below, maps to Marker ZI 735, which is annotated with the name *"Gale"*. 

Searching for *"Gale"* in the Brisbane City Council **[Grave location search](https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/community-and-safety/community-support/cemeteries/grave-location-search)** you find, by looking at each entry for *"Gale"*, Ruby Mary Gale, who was buried in 1-1-38 on 24 November 1924. You'll also find 	Ada Florence Morgan buried in 1-1-38 on 11 November 1878 - perhaps this is the B 663 crossed out in the Portion Book. 

Only the surname is recorded in the Portion Book so you can't link a marker to a specific person, although you may be able to imply a link by the order the markers are recorded and the date of each person's death.

## Unmarked Graves

There are many unmarked graves in Toowong Cementery. Take care when you walk across the grass as unmarked graves can leave hidden hollows that are a trip hazard.
