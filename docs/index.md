## Visit Toowong Cemetery

<img class="full-width" src="assets/main-entrance.jpg" alt="Toowong Cemetery Main Entrance" width="70%">

*<small>The Toowong Cemetery Main Entrance was designed by the Colonial Architect <b>[F.D.G. Stanley](research/francis-drummond-grenville-stanley/)</b> and erected in 1873-1874</small>*

### Driving

If you're driving to the cemetery, it has two entrances:

- The main entrance at **[Frederick Street, Toowong](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Toowong+Cemetery/@-27.4772749,152.9818283,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x6b9150c2f0f2e23f:0xf02a35bd720a310!8m2!3d-27.4772714!4d152.9839608)**,  can only be entered via a slip road beside the Toowong roundabout, approaching from the west
- The back entrance, **[opposite 26 Richer Street, Toowong](https://www.google.com/maps/place/25+Richer+St,+Toowong+QLD+4066/@-27.4737507,152.9767263,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x6b9150dd31b12cc5:0xc3a1deb2fe09484!8m2!3d-27.4737555!4d152.978915)** is much easier to access

Parking is available inside the cemetery.

### Walking

If you're walking, in addition to the entries above, you can enter via:

- the pedestrian ramp from Mt Coot-tha Road, opposite the Mt Coot-tha Botanic Gardens. Turn right at the top of the ramp and walk downhill to go to Canon Garland Place
- Frederick Street gate (opposite Sleath Street) that leads onto Steel Rudd Avenue (previously 4^th^ Avenue)
- the many informal entries off Birdwood Terrace

### Public Transport

If you're using public transport to get here, use the **[TransLink Journey Planner](https://jp.translink.com.au/plan-your-journey/journey-planner)** to plan your trip. Be aware some results tell you to walk across the road at the Toowong roundabout - this is not safe and you may need to walk a long way to find a safe place to cross Milton Road or the Western Freeway. Options are: 

- cross Milton Road at its intersection with Morley Street
- cross the Western Freeway using the **[Canon Garland Overpass](https://garlandmemorial.com/2022/06/03/canon-garland-overpass/)**, a bike and walking bridge accessed from Anzac Park
- choose a bus that avoids the need to cross major roads (e.g. Routes **[471](https://jp.translink.com.au/plan-your-journey/timetables/bus/t/471/outbound/)**, **[598](https://jp.translink.com.au/plan-your-journey/timetables/bus/t/598)**, **[599](https://jp.translink.com.au/plan-your-journey/timetables/bus/t/599)**)

## When you arrive

If you enter the main entrance, you'll find: 

- **Canon Garland Place** named after **[Canon David John Garland][Garland]**. The Flagpole here is the departure point for our **[guided heritage tours](guided-tours.md)** 
- a **Museum** operated by the Friends of Toowong Cemetery, and opened before and after our guided heritage tours
- the **[Office](https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/community-and-safety/community-support/cemeteries/toowong-cemetery)**, where Brisbane City Council staff can answer your enquiries and help locate graves and memorial sites
- **Toilets** - the only ones available in the cemetery

<img class="full-width" src="assets/flag-pole.jpg" alt="Canon Garland Place" width="70%">

*<small>The Stone of Remembrance, Cross of Sacrifice, and Flagpole in Canon Garland Place</small>*

If you enter via the Richer Street back gate, to get to Canon Garland Place:

- turn right into Dr. Lilian Cooper Drive (previously Boundary Road) and continue to the Shelter Shed 
- veer left at the Shelter Shed down the one‑way William Brown Avenue (previously 14^th^ Avenue) 
- at the end, turn right into Emma Miller Avenue (previously 8^th^ Avenue) to arrive behind Canon Garland Place, where you can park on the right side of the road
