# Guided Tours

## Guided Tours

Friends of Toowong Cemetery volunteers guide you on 10 different heritage walks each year.

**Guided tours are free** but donations are appreciated to help us continue **[our work](about/index.md)**. 

There's no need to book, just meet under the flagpole, in Canon Garland Place at the Toowong Cemetery. There is plenty of parking available inside the cemetery. Wear a hat, enclosed shoes, and bring a water bottle.

    - We apologise in advance if you come to the cemetery but are unable to join the tour due to it being over-subscribed.

Hear amazing true stories of the Moreton Bay Penal Settlement, Brisbane’s lost graveyard, horrific hangings, bloody murders, and, in among this horrible history, be prepared for some spine-tingling tales of the ghosts that are said to reside within Toowong Cemetery.
