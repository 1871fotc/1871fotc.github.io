# Headstones

In cemeteries, people are often commemorated with a headstone or a plaque on a columbarium. Headstones can reflect a person's beliefs or values, their cultural identity, and their relationships to other people, organisations, or events.

## Archaeological digs

Friends of Toowong Cemetery and the [University of Queensland Archaeology Department](https://social-science.uq.edu.au/undergraduate/archaeology), have been searching for buried headstones in the cemetery grounds since 2006. 

Headstones uncovered in the **[archaeological digs](archaeological-digs.md)** are believed to come from two sources: 

- **[Headstones lost from Paddington Cemetery](lost-paddington-headstones.md)** in the 1930's 
- Toowong Cemetery headstones destroyed and buried in the 1970's as part of the Brisbane City Council's 'Beautification Scheme'
