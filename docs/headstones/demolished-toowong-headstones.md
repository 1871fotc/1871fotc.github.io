# Demolished Toowong Cemetery Headstones

By April 1975, Toowong Cemetery was full with all plots sold. The Brisbane City Council Health Dept was ordered by the then Mayor to start a project to remove hundreds of family owned headstones and grave surrounds in Toowong, Lutwyche, South Brisbane, Balmoral, and God's Acre Pioneer cemetery. Headstones (most of which just needing weeding) were removed from these cemeteries with the aim to make open parklands.

Mayors, soldiers, politicians all fell victim to the clearance. At Toowong Cemetery, headstones were demolished and buried in the canal. The [Toowong Cemetery heritage listing](https://apps.des.qld.gov.au/heritage-register/detail/?id=601773) suggests, "*approximately 1,000 memorials were removed from Toowong*". Intervention in 1979 saw an end to the "beautification scheme". The Cemetery reopened in 1998 with approximately 450 plots for sale.

    2. if record is an individual, add link to memorial search

    Stage 2

    1. split the record into multiple entries; one per person, separated by grave location (e.g. split 1-2-3&4 into 1-2-3 and 1-2-4)
    2. add links to memorial search for each person
    3. link to individual story page if Friends of Toowong Cemetery have written one.
    4. add headstone photo, marker number, and headstone report to existing individual stories.

    Stage 3

    - add entries for headstones / people without photo or report evidence
    - add column for Portion Book page with circled grave number as evidence that grave was destoried in "beautification scheme"
    - publish Portion Book

    Stage 4

    - create a story page for each person and link from last name
