# Demolished Toowong Cemetery Headstones

By April 1975, Toowong Cemetery was full with all plots sold. The Brisbane City Council Health Dept was ordered by the then Mayor to start a project to remove hundreds of family owned headstones and grave surrounds in Toowong, Lutwyche, South Brisbane, Balmoral, and God's Acre Pioneer cemetery. Headstones were removed from these cemeteries with the aim to make open parklands.

Mayors, soldiers, politicians all fell victim to the clearance. At Toowong Cemetery, headstones were demolished and buried in the canal. The [Toowong Cemetery heritage listing](https://apps.des.qld.gov.au/heritage-register/detail/?id=601773) suggests, "*approximately 1,000 memorials were removed from Toowong*". Intervention in 1979 saw an end to the "beautification scheme". The Cemetery reopened in 1998 with approximately 450 plots for sale.

??? Warning "Work in progress"

    We're slowly checking the data and adding it to the table below. 

    Our plans:

    Stage 1:

    1. Add 1 record per headstone.
    2. Check that the headstone was actually demolished.

    Stage 2: 

    1. Add all surnames of people buried in the grave to the Last Name entry. For example: for 18-35-24&25, record Dick, Lovelock, and Russell, instead of just Dick.
    1. Update individual story pages, e.g.: [Magdalene Dick](../../research/magdalene-dick/), with:  
        - headstone photo (if appropriate). Reduce image size
        - inscription
        - grave marker number
        - link to grave report 

<!--
    Backlog:

    2. split the headstone record into multiple entries; one per person, separated by grave location (e.g. split 1-2-3&4 into 1-2-3 and 1-2-4)
        - link surname to individual story page if Friends of Toowong Cemetery have written one. 
    1. Create a individual story page for each person and link from last name. (This could create ~3000 pages) For example: [Cecelia Head](../../research/17-11-11-cecelia-head/)
    2. Add links to memorial search for each person in the table (~3000 links)

    **Headstone Location**

    - The headstone location is in Portion - Section - Grave format.

    - Headstone photos and Grave reports © Brisbane City Council. 

    **Data quality** 

    - There are different spellings of names in the grave report, headstone inscription, and Memorial Search record. (We use a judgement to choose the best name to publish.)
