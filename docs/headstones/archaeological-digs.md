## Where did the buried headstones come from?

The headstones discovered in Toowong Cemetery Archaeological digs are believed to come from two sources: 

- **[Headstones from the Paddington Cemetery Reserved Area](lost-paddington-headstones.md)** dumped in Toowong Cemetery in the 1930's
- Headstones from Toowong Cemetery destroyed and buried in the 1970's as part of the Brisbane City Council's 'Beautification Scheme'

Archaeologist [Dr. Jon Prangell](https://social-science.uq.edu.au/profile/138/jon-prangnell) from The University of Queensland, and member of Friends of Toowong Cemetery, explains to Radio Station 4BC how the cityâ€™s forgotten headstones are being rediscovered.

## Finding Thomas Mowbray

Mr. Mowbray was a [prominent police magistrate in Brisbane](https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/82175317). His headstone was removed as part of the 'Beautification Scheme', and discovered in 2011 as part of the Toowong Cemetery Archaeological digs. The headstone was reinstated in its original location.
