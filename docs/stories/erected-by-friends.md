## Peter Jackson <small>(5‑28‑1)</small>

Peter was born on 3 July 1861 at Christiansted, St Croix in what was then the Danish West Indies. He was the son of Peter Jackson, a warehouseman and his wife, and grandson of a freed slave who had been owned by a planter with the surname of Jackson. 

Arriving in Sydney about 1880, he worked on the waterfront and in hotels before drifting into boxing in 1882 under the tuition of Larry Foley. In April 1888 he left for the United States and Britain, where he fought twenty-eight of the best boxers of England and America between 1888 and 1892, losing to none. He was one of the finest boxers never to fight for a world championship. Racial prejudice prevented him from being given the chance to win the world heavyweight crown. 

He died of tuberculosis at Roma in Queensland on 13 July 1901. £130 was raised by public subscription for a memorial over his grave. The unveiling ceremony performed by the Hon E B Forrest, MLA for North Brisbane took place on 12 May 1903 in the presence of most of those in the athletic and sporting world of southeast Queensland.

Could add George Heiniger (16-22-17) d. ca. 23-02-1915

Grave of World War I Soldier, Private George Heiniger, at Toowong Cemetery, Brisbane, Queensland, 1915

His comrades funded the erection of a marble headpiece above his grave at the Toowong Cemetery which was engraved with a miniature saddle and crossed rifles. The grave was surrounded by a concrete kerbing. After paying for the tombstone the balance of the money raised was used to purchase two artificial wreaths which were placed on the grave.

Private George Heiniger of the Unallotted Light Horse died on 21 February 1915 at the Enoggera Military Training Camp in Brisbane at the age of 18. The night before his death he complained of a headache and giddiness. The next morning he was very ill and his comrades took him on a stretcher to the field hospital at the camp. Once there he lapsed into unconsciousness and died at 9.15 am that day. A court of enquiry found that he had died of heat stroke, although his comrades stated that he had not been in the sun and had not engaged in violent exercise or work preceding his illness.
