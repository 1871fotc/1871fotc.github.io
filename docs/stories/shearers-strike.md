Welsh-born Sir Samuel Walker Griffith (1845-1920) was Premier of Queensland during the Shearers' Strike. A brilliant and hard-working lawyer, he prepared the first draft of the Australian Constitution in 1891 and was absent from Queensland for the first three months of the strike attending meetings in Hobart and Sydney, the latter for the first National Australasian Convention. 

He was Chief Justice of the Queensland Supreme Court from 1893 until 1903 when he was appointed the first Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia, a position he held until his retirement in 1919.
