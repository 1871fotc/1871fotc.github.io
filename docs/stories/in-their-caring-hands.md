# In their caring hands  

**Commemorating the role of nurses, doctors and other health professionals**

At Toowong Cemetery are many health professionals; nurses, doctors, dispensers and others, some of whom gave their lives in the course of their duties. This is just a small number of those people who spent their working lives caring for others.

## Lilian Violet Cooper and Mary Josephine Bedford <small>(8‑69‑13/14)</small>

Dr Lilian Cooper was the first woman to practise medicine in Queensland. She studied medicine at the London School of Medicine for Women and obtained an MD from Durham. While studying there, Lilian met and shared lodgings with Mary Bedford who was to become her lifelong companion. 

Dr Cooper commenced private practise in Brisbane in 1891 at The Mansions, in George Street. She was a great advocate of sterilisation and the use of protective clothing during surgery. Lilian died on 19 August 1947 aged 86. Mary Bedford died in 1955. Mt Olivet Hospital stands on the site of their Main St home at Kangaroo Point.
