## Lieutenant-Colonel James Forsyth Thallon <small>(11‑71‑14)</small>

1847‑1911

Lieutenant-Colonel James Forsyth Thallon was the Queensland Commissioner for Railways from 1902-1911. [His obituary in The Daily Telegraph](https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/175257059/19207453) stated he was born in Markinch, Fifeshire in 1847, the son of a Scottish engineer of the old school. At age 15 he entered service in Edinburgh on the Edinburgh, Perth and Dundee Railway as an apprentice. He was eventually promoted to General Traffic Manager for Queensland in 1889 and to Deputy Commissioner of Railways in 1896. On the death of the Commissioner for Railways, Mr Gray in November 1902, Thallon was appointed to the role initially for a term of seven years, and on the expiration of that term, for a further five years. 

Thallon died at the Mater Hospital in Brisbane on 24 March 1911 from a cerebral haemorrhage after contracting Dengue fever. At the time of his death, Thallon was regarded as the most distinguished Railways Commissioner in Australia, and one of the most loved men in Queensland. More than 10,000 people stood in drenching rain as his funeral procession passed toward his final resting place in Toowong Cemetery. The procession moved from his Clayfield residence, led by four mounted policemen, followed by the Railway Band who were playing the ‘Dead March from Saul’. Family members and dignitaries from all levels of government and representatives of industry followed the carriage bearing the coffin.

## George Phillips <small>(11‑51‑2)</small>

1843‑1921

George Phillips died on 3 June 1921 at the age of 77 after being known as one of the pioneers who opened up North Queensland, the possibilities of the Gulf country, and who laid out the town of Normanton. A surveyor and civil engineer, he also made [many valuable contributions to The Daily Telegraph](https://trove.nla.gov.au/search/category/newspapers?keyword=%22G%20Phillips%22&l-state=Queensland&l-title=840&l-decade=191&l-category=Article) on the physical aspects, climatology, natural and artificial products of the country, and the life and manners of its people. For many years he was a leading member and fellow of the Royal Geographical Society, and contributed several valuable papers. During his funeral service at the City Tabernacle, Reverend Richer, a good friend of George Phillips, spoke of the man and his great service to Queensland.

## James Cowlishaw <small>(11‑41‑7A)</small>

1834‑1913

James Cowlishaw was an architect, newspaper director, trustee and politician. He was born in Sydney in 1834 and came to Brisbane in 1861 to practise as an architect. He designed a few private homes including *Hanworth House* at East Brisbane and *Oakwal* at Windsor, both of which still exist, but he was mostly concerned with commercial buildings and designed some of the finest buildings of the period, including Brisbane Grammar School. He acquired a large interest in the Queensland Trustees Limited, and was a founder of the Brisbane Gas Company in 1864. He was also one of the founding trustees of the Toowong Cemetery.

Cowlishaw was Chairman of Directors of *The Daily Telegraph* for many years. Later his brother George, who is also buried in this grave, became Director of *The Daily Telegraph* for an unbroken period of 20 years from 1893 until his sudden death from a seizure on 6 January 1913. 

Cowlishaw’s wife, Charlotte (née Owen) was the second burial in the grave following her death in 1914.

## Sir Charles Lilley <small>(12‑15‑15)</small>

1830‑1897

Born at Newcastle upon Tyne, England in 1830, Charles Lilley arrived in Sydney in 1856 as an assisted immigrant. That year he was articled in Brisbane to Robert Little, the district’s senior solicitor. On completing his articles, he joined the printer William Bellbridge to lease the Moreton Bay Courier and became involved in the separation movement. 

Following separation, Lilley narrowly won the Fortitude Valley seat and continued to represent the electorate until the end of his parliamentary career. In 1865 he became Attorney‑General in the Herbert Ministry and in 1868 gained the unusual dual role of Premier and Attorney‑General. In 1869, as colonial secretary, he was responsible for establishing free education throughout Queensland, making it the first Australian state to do so. In 1874 he was appointed Judge of the Supreme Court and in June 1879 became Chief Justice. He accepted a knighthood in October 1881. 

## Sir Samuel Walker Griffith <small>(12‑11‑6/7)</small>

1845‑1920

This modest grave contradicts the vital contribution this man made to Queensland and Australian politics and law. Griffith’s political career began in 1872 when he won the seat of East Moreton. He served as Attorney‑General from 1874‑1878 and in May 1879 replaced John Douglas as Liberal Party leader. During this rise to leadership he held three portfolios: Attorney‑General, Secretary for Public Instruction (1876‑1879) and Secretary for Public Works (1878‑1879). Griffith was a ‘founding father’ of Australia’s Constitution and Federation. In 1891 he chiefly drew up a draft constitution. From 1899‑1903 he was Lieutenant Governor of Queensland. Griffith died in his New Farm home ‘Merthyr’ and is buried here with his wife and eldest son Llewelyn, an engineer who died aged 29.

## Governor Blackall <small>(Mount Blackall)</small>

1809‑1871

Samuel Wensley Blackall was the second Governor of Queensland, serving between 1868 and 1871. Born in Dublin, Blackall’s colonial service began in 1851 when he was appointed Lieutenant Governor of Dominica for six years. From 1862‑1865 he was Governor of Sierra Leone and in 1865 became Governor‑in‑Chief of the West African Settlements. During his three years as a Governor of Queensland he became extremely popular, willing to help public causes. While on a picnic in this area, Blackall’s ill health prompted him to choose this hilltop for his grave. In January 1871, Blackall was the first to be buried in Toowong Cemetery and his impressive memorial continues to dominate the hill now named Mount Blackall.

In 1866 he entered the Legislative Assembly and pursued a political career which included ministerial positions such as Minister of Lands and Works, and Public Instruction, the Colonial Secretary in various governments and a term as Premier. From 1881‑1898 Palmer was President of the Legislative Council.

1812‑1879

Maurice Charles O’Connell was the grandson of Governor William Bligh, commander of the infamous HMS Bounty and Governor of New South Wales from 1805. Born in Sydney and educated in Europe, he raised and led a regiment of Irish volunteers in the Spanish Carlist wars, rising to the rank of General in the British Auxiliary Legion. Before leaving for Spain, he married Eliza Emily Ie Geyt at Jersey. When the legion was disbanded, O’Connell sailed back to New South Wales with several Spanish decorations and in 1845 was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Council. He was a founding member of Queensland’s Legislative Council, following the colony’s separation from New South Wales in 1859. He was granted a knighthood in 1868 when, as administrator of the government, he was host to the Duke of Edinburgh. He died in Parliament House on 23 March 1879, leaving no children. 

<!-- insert photo -->

## The Bell family <small>(13‑84‑8)</small>

Sir Joshua Peter Bell (1827‑1881), was a squatter and politician. Bell’s Jimbour Station became one of the most successful on the Darling Downs. At the Grange Stud in Ipswich he was a prize breeder of horses much sought after in the United States, winning all important races on the Queensland racing calendar. For many years he was president of the Queensland Turf Club. The highlights of Bell’s political career, which began in 1860, are listed on his headstone. On December 1881 Bell died suddenly in a cab in Queen Street. 

Joshua Thomas Bell (1863‑1911), a barrister and politician, was the eldest son of Joshua Peter Bell. He was a skilful electioneer and public speaker, but his elegant appearance and pompous attitude alienated many of his peers. He was a keen rower, rifle shooter and patron of the arts, securing the first cultural grant in Queensland.

## Raff family <small>(13‑79‑1)</small>

George Raff (1815‑1889), born in Forres, Morayshire, Scotland, was a successful merchant, sugar‑grower and a founding Queensland politician. Raff arrived in Sydney in January 1839 on the Earl Durham. His efforts were largely responsible for the direct wool trade between Brisbane and London. Raff strongly believed in Queensland separation from New South Wales and, after this was achieved in 1859, represented Brisbane in the first parliament. 

Alexander Raff (1820‑1914) was a pastoralist on the Darling Downs and a company director. He was a director of the Scottish Australian Land and Mortgage Company and National Mutual Life Association. From 1884 until 1910 he was a member of the Legislative Council.

## Carl Feilberg <small>(13‑71‑15)</small>

1844‑1887

Carl Feilberg was born in Copenhagen in 1844. At age five, Feilberg was placed with relatives in Edinburgh, Scotland. Suffering from a serious case of tuberculosis, Feilberg was advised to migrate to Australia in the hope a better climate would improve his health. He arrived in Sydney in 1867 and travelled to Rockhampton carrying a letter of introduction to Scottish squatter Archibald Buchanan. He gained ‘colonial experience’ working on Mr Buchanan’s properties as a shepherd, store and bookkeeper. The knowledge he gained in the outback, including his experiences with the Native Police and the darker sides of the colony’s frontier policies would later influence his work as a journalist, political commentator and author. 

After leaving Maryborough in 1875 he moved to Cooktown, then Brisbane where he became part‑proprietor and editor of the Queensland Patriot newspaper, later renamed The Daily News. Feilberg was arguably the most persistent human rights advocate and pioneer of compassion in the history of colonial Queensland. 

After the closure of the Daily News at the beginning of 1879, he found employment at the Brisbane Courier as a political commentator and lead writer as the editor of The Queenslander. A change in the proprietorship of the Brisbane Newspaper Company in December 1880, found his views at odds with the new owners and he was gradually relegated to more subordinate positions. He resigned and some years later he was offered the position of editor‑in‑chief of the Brisbane Newspaper Company. He remained fully active in this position until a few weeks before his death on 25 October 1887, at only 43 years of age.

In operations west of Pretoria they took part in the defence of Elands River camp during August 1900 and later in November at Rhenoster Kop, both significant battles of that conflict. Contrary to popular belief, Trooper Cobb was not wounded in South Africa and returned unscathed to Brisbane where the contingent was disbanded on 20 June 1901. Trooper Cobb died of an apparent stroke on 3 July 1901 and was buried with full military honours.

The son of Doctor Bancroft, Thomas Lane Bancroft’s career included the positions of Quarantine Officer of Brisbane, Government Medical Officer, and Medical Officer on Palm Island. Shy, generous and kindly, Thomas shunned publicity, and although his desire for a full‑time research appointment was never fulfilled, his contribution to natural science amounted to 84 research papers including furthering his father’s work on filariasis. Doctor Bancroft was a general practitioner of the best type – a first‑rate all‑round surgeon, physician, gynaecologist and midwife.

## Petrie family <small>(13‑5‑3)</small>

The Petrie family is one of Queensland’s oldest and most prominent. Andrew Petrie (not buried at Toowong Cemetery) is regarded as Queensland’s first free settler, emigrating on the Stirling Castle from Edinburgh to Sydney in 1831, then moving to Brisbane in 1837 to become Superintendent of Works. In 1840 he established the family stonemason business, which from 1882‑1981, was located opposite the main gates of Toowong Cemetery. This long‑established business was responsible for many headstones in this cemetery and their trademark can be found on some graves. The Petrie’s also built the GPO, Customs House and Parliament House, among other public buildings. 

John Petrie (1822‑1892), Andrew’s eldest son, was Brisbane’s first Mayor from 1859‑1862 and was an alderman for several years. As Mayor, he had the honour of receiving Sir George Bowen as Queensland’s first Governor when the colony achieved separation in 1859. 

Also a stonemason, John Petrie’s best remembered work is the conversion of the windmill on Wickham Terrace to a signal station in 1861. John’s son, Andrew Lang Petrie (1854‑1928), a monumental mason and contractor, entered the Legislative Assembly on 29 April 1893 and remained a member until 7 May 1926.

A rare memorial of the Anglo‑Boer conflict, this monument is a significant reminder of the emerging nationalism and contemporary attitudes to war.

    Adjacent to this is a tall obelisk for the ‘A’ Battery Memorial, a shape which originates from the architecture of ancient Egypt.

Prior to Federation, each of the Australian colonies maintained its own defence force. These forces were largely comprised of part‑time volunteers and a small number of permanent officers and men. This memorial is to the men of Queensland’s permanent force, ‘A’ Battery, Queensland Artillery. All of those named on the memorial died while serving in the Battery, but only one, Driver Sydney Walker, died while on active service. Walker was serving with the first Queensland Contingent to the South African war when he died of enteric fever at Bloemfontein.

    Walking parallel with the fence and turning right at Ludlow’s grave end the tour at the leadlight windowed Temple of Peace which lies beneath shady trees at the entrance to the cemetery.

## Temple of Peace <small>(4‑38‑14)</small>

This [state‑heritage‑listed monument](https://apps.des.qld.gov.au/heritage-register/detail/?id=600334) was designed and largely constructed by Richard Ramo in memory of his three sons killed in World War I, to his adopted son Fred who died tragically in 1923, and later to the family dog. The dedication of the mausoleum was attended by several thousand people, largely pacifists, socialists and members of the Industrial Workers of the World. The temple bears several leaded marble inscriptions expressing Ramo’s bitter hatred of war and details of the deaths of his sons. One particularly sombre inscription reads: “*All my hope lies buried here*”.
