## John Jack <small>(10‑77‑24)</small>

AIF Service number: 6789.

Born in Edinburgh circa 1884 to John Jack and Catherine Hunter. John senior was born 1859 in Edinburgh and his father was born in Aberdeen in 1825 and finally I have found his father was born in Banff in 1790 and is the only John Jack I can find there which leads to the photo on the front of this pamphlet. Our John on the first application was a motor mechanic and on the 2^nd^ application he was a farmer living in St Lucia Rd, Toowong. The two medical records are worth comparing. Age 31 years and 10 months - 32 years and 4 months. 5' 9" against 5' 8", 135lb -131lb. 35"-35 1/4" chest. Complexion reddish-fresh, eyes dark-blue, hair dark brown- dark and scars 3 vacc on left arm-none?? Are we talking about the same fellow here? He joined on the 16 August 1916 and discharged 12 September 1916 due to bad teeth. Joined again 17 October 1916 and accepted into 22^nd^ reinforcements for the 15^th^ Battalion this time with dentures. He embarked as a private on *HMAT Kyarra* 17 November 1916 and returned as a corporal 1 July 1919 on the SS Frankfurt.

In both applications he was single however I have letters written by a lady in South Melbourne sent to army HQ searching for a missing husband. She describes John Hunter Jack pretty well. She says she has contacted the army as her father-in-law in Edinburgh has contacted her to say young John has had leave at home in Scotland. She supplied a wedding certificate and a sworn statement and applied to be put on his records as next of kin. Now we know why he was willing to have his teeth out to be accepted.
We note that his headstone reads "My brother John Jack formerly of Edinburgh. I would say Lily Jack must have given up on him.
