# The Forgotten 

**Stories of World War One soldiers in unmarked graves**

!!! warning "Grumose detail"

    Often the scars of war could not be seen and soldiers suffered from a range of mental illnesses. Many soldiers committed suicide particularly when they could not find work, or bear the pain of their physical or mental illnesses.

    Some of these details are hidden in boxes like this. You can click to open and read them if you chooose.

## The Dunwich Benevolent Asylum

Many soldiers were sent to Dunwich on Stradbroke Island to convalesce or for treatment for alcoholism. Many died there. 

The Asylum had been established in 1865 to house and care for people who were unable to provide for themselves – the poor and destitute, the disabled, diseased, the old and infirm, and in some cases, those with untreated mental illness. It was a major institution, with over 1,100 inmates at the ==turn of the century==.
 
Within the Asylum, the Dunwich Inebriate Institution had been established to manage alcoholics. “Inebriates” found drunk on the streets of Brisbane and country towns could be sentenced by a magistrate to serve a period of time in Dunwich, to be “treated” for their condition, or people could refer themselves to the Institution voluntarily. 

For a few years the Inebriate Institution had operated on Peel Island, but it was moved back to Dunwich just as men started returning from war. Over 450 men who had returned from fighting overseas spent time at Dunwich. At least 220 of these were admitted as “inebriates”.

## The Goodna Mental Asylum 

The asylum at Goodna has had several names, firstly the Woogaroo Lunatic Asylum then Goodna Asylum for the Insane, Brisbane Special Hospital and Wolston Park Hospital.
According to Wikipedia, by January 1942, 110 returned soldiers were inmates of Goodna Mental Hospital and the Australian Government expressed concern about the growing numbers being admitted. War veterans had become a significant minority of the hospital population since the final years of the First World War and Ellerton had decided upon consideration, that using existing institutions was preferable to building new facilities.

In 1923 the bad food at Goodna mental asylum made the newspapers where the headline was, “**200% worse than army food**”.
