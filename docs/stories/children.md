#  The Children  

**Suffer the little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me**

Brisbane’s infant mortality rate in the latter half of the 19^th^ century equalled that of the worse slums of the United Kingdom. More children died in spring and summer than winter and these rates did not improve between the mid-1870s and the 1890s.^1^ In December 1876, 52 children under the age of eight were buried at Toowong Cemetery. The most common causes of death included childhood diseases, infections, drowning, burns and scalds. The most dramatic improvement did not occur until the fifth decade of the twentieth century and the advent of penicillin.

> A Lovely Boy possess'd of every charm <br>
> Could not the Tyrants fatal dart disarm?  <br>
> Engaging sweetness met the destined blo'  <br>
> And bid farewell to every human woe <br>
> His spotless Soul now to his God restor'd <br>

## Hiron Family <small>(13‑20‑9)</small>

Agnes Elizabeth died in September 1875 aged 11 years. Yet another George died in December 1901 aged 15 years. Following the custom of the day, names were recycled until a child lived long enough for a name to ‘stick’.
