## John Petrie <small>(13‑5‑3)</small>

John was born on 15 January 1822 at Edinburgh, eldest son of Andrew Petrie (1798–1872) and his wife Mary, née Cuthbertson. John assumed responsibility for the management of Petrie & Son after his [father's blindness](https://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks20/2000451h.html#ch2-10) in 1848 forced him to retire. John became sole proprietor and changed the firm's name to John Petrie.

On 5 September 1850 Petrie married Jane Keith, daughter of Daniel McNaught of Dunbarton, Scotland. The family grew to five sons and five daughters. John Petrie topped the poll in Brisbane's first municipal election in 1859 and was mayor three times by 1862 and served as an Alderman until 1867. He was also an active member of the first Masonic lodge in Queensland. A staunch Presbyterian, he was an elder and worked on building St Paul's Church. John Petrie died on 8 December 1892.

## George Prentice <small>(9‑41‑1)</small>

In 1864, George Prentice & Son operated [a stone yard in Charlotte Street](https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/1264492?searchTerm=prentice), Brisbane. They executed "every description of monumental work", and supplied "hearthstones, window sills, steps, coping, and paving". The business may have been impacted by the March 1864 flood.

In August 1867 the Monumental Stone Works was advertised as operating in "[Turbot-Street, between George and Roma streets](https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/1286460?searchTerm=headstones)". Other advertisements described the location as,

Quetta* for a trip to England. Both were lost in [the wreck *S.S.

## Timothy Wrafter <small>(n/a)</small>

The name T. Wrafter, dates back to the late 1800’s when Timothy Wrafter, a stonemason from Ireland, set up a monumental business in Nudgee.  As time progressed and the firm grew, he encouraged his nephew, Timothy, also a stonemason from Ireland, to emigrate to Australia and work in his business.

Timothy eventually procured the business from his uncle and as work increased and his two sons Denis and Joseph grew older, they were apprenticed as stonemasons, hence the beginning of the firm, T. Wrafter & Sons.
