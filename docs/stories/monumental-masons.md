These headstones were created by Brisbane's early Monumental Masons. In 1909, the [Stonemasons' Trade Board stated](https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/19575621):

>'Monumental mason' shall mean a stonemason who is engaged in preparing or fixing all stone for cemetery purposes, or in preparing marble or cutting in inscriptions for cemetery or other work.

<!--
In 1909 the Stonemasons' Trade Board divided Masons into [Building, Monumental, and Porphyry masons](https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/19575621), each with different minimum wages, working conditions, and apprenticeship rules.

Frank Martin Downes was [born in 1848](https://www.familyhistory.bdm.qld.gov.au/details/8519478a9dd500f066995d5b3ed0b3e9840b9c3cc8040d7b631c767b9bf2f705) to Henry Downes and his wife Mary Ann, née Martin. He was a [Manager at John Petrie & Son](https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/97526386?searchTerm=MONUMENTAL) monumental works until the firm went bankrupt in 1894. The [F.M.

## John Petrie <small>(13‑5‑3)</small>

John was born on 15 January 1822 at Edinburgh, eldest son of Andrew Petrie (1798–1872) and his wife Mary, née Cuthbertson. John assumed responsibility for the management of Petrie & Son after his [father's blindness](https://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks20/2000451h.html#ch2-10) in 1848 forced him to retire. John became sole proprietor and changed the firm's name to John Petrie.

On 5 September 1850 Petrie married Jane Keith, daughter of Daniel McNaught of Dunbarton, Scotland. The family grew to five sons and five daughters. John Petrie topped the poll in Brisbane's first municipal election in 1859 and was mayor three times by 1862 and served as an Alderman until 1867. He was also an active member of the first Masonic lodge in Queensland. A staunch Presbyterian, he was an elder and worked on building St Paul's Church. John Petrie died on 8 December 1892.

## John Simmonds <small>(4‑3‑27)</small>

ca. 1829 - 23-01-1889

John Simmonds operated a monumental masory business Brisbane. He created a fountain that was placed in the lawns immediately in front of the Queensland Houses of Parliament. In [*The Queenslander*, 9 December 1882](https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/19788278?searchTerm=Simmonds%20monumental%20mason) an article about the Brisbane Botanic Gardens, reported:

>A very pleasing and attractive addition has been made recently in the shape of a fountain, chaste and neat in its design rather than elaborate, but which, in the opinion of many, will not detract in the least from its usefulness or general effect. This addition is placed conspicuously on one of the lawns immediately in front of the Houses of Parliament, and when connected with the Enoggera main, and put into play, will have a very pleasing and salutary effect. This work of art — for such it may be termed — is the production of Mr. J. Simmonds, monumental mason and sculptor, of Adelaide street.

The name T. Wrafter, dates back to the late 1800’s when Timothy Wrafter, a stonemason from Ireland, set up a monumental business in Nudgee.  As time progressed and the firm grew, he encouraged his nephew, Timothy, also a stonemason from Ireland, to emigrate to Australia and work in his business.

Timothy eventually procured the business from his uncle and as work increased and his two sons Denis and Joseph grew older, they were apprenticed as stonemasons, hence the beginning of the firm, T. Wrafter & Sons.
