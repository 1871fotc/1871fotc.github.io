## Thomas Dowse <small>(13‑58‑22)</small>

Thomas Dowse was born at Hackney, London. Aged 15, he was accused of theft by his mother, tried at Middlesex on 16 September 1824, convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment. He was transported to New South Wales in the *Florentia* which arrived in January 1828. At St John's, Parramatta, in 19 November 1832 he married Ann Kelly. Only three of their seven children survived infancy. In 1836, Dowse was granted a ticket‑of‑leave and a conditional pardon in 1839. When the Moreton Bay District was opened for free settlement he decided to go there to see what opportunity awaited a man who was in good health and not afraid of hard work. 

The family arrived aboard the *Falcon* on 9 July 1842. Noticing the need of a ferry across the river, he bought a skiff which by 1843 had earned three times its value. By 1846 he was established as an auctioneer and commission agent, and also had the agency for the Sydney Morning Herald. At his premises in Queen Street he sold almost anything from shirts, frock coats, cutlery, looking‑glasses and books to livestock. His auction mart also became a centre for discussion of social reform, for perhaps no one then had a greater horror of the degrading convict system or worked harder to end it. 

A widower at 47, in Brisbane in 1856 he married Sarah Ann Fairfax; they had three sons and two daughters. Because of his work for separation and contributions to the press under the pseudonym of Old Tom, he was appointed with Walter Hill, director of the Botanic Gardens, to arrange the Queensland exhibit at the London Exhibition in 1862. In this task they were successful and received a public testimonial in 1864. When the first town clerk of Brisbane retired, Dowse was elected in January 1862. He retired from office in 1869 but continued in business until he died aged 75 at his home, *Hillside*, Milton, on 9 November 1885.

## Agnes Susan Maclean <small>(5‑107‑19)</small>

Agnes Susan Maclean was christened Susannah Agnes Kable, the grand‑daughter of First Fleet Convicts Henry Kable and Susannah Holmes and Second Fleet Marine William Charlton and Convict Mary Gittos. Born in Windsor, NSW; Susannah was the eldest of 6 children. Susannah's father William Nathaniel Kable died when she was 11. 

When Susannah was 19, she married John Shand Maclean, the son of an Equity Court Clerk from Jamaica at St Mary's Cathedral in Sydney. The first of Susannah's 10 children was born in 1847. Susannah followed her husband around his various interests. John attempted farming and for a time taught at a gentlemen's academy in the Richmond area of New South Wales. By 1856, the ever growing family had settled in the Burnett region. Susannah's final four children were born on various cattle properties in the region. 

Tragedy struck in November 1862 when John fell off a horse and died on Gyranda Station near Cracow. Susannah buried her husband between the homestead and the river the assistance of her brother and brother‑in‑law. Susannah was left with 10 children under the age of 15 and a cattle property to manage. She suffered another setback in the 1870s when a fire tore through Gyranda, destroying all her photographs and heirlooms. Susannah brought up her large family with the assistance of her brother and sister‑in‑law on a nearby property. 

Agnes Susannah, as she was now known, claimed the right to vote in 1905, in her 80^th^ year. She is then registered on the electoral roll living with her youngest daughter Elvina and her school‑master husband Charles Marshall at the Nerang State Schoolhouse. Agnes died of nephritis at the Brisbane General Hospital on the 20^th^ of January 1911. She was buried next to her sister‑in‑law Mary Ann Kable.
