# Anchors Aweigh! 

**Maritime stories from Toowong Cemetery**

The anchor is a symbol found on many Christian graves but it does not necessarily point to a maritime career. The source for the symbol is Hebrews 6:19, 

>Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast.

The allegorical figure, Hope, is often shown holding an anchor. Anchors may be shown with its rope crudely cut or a broken chain link to indicate the deceased has been removed from the land of the living, often prematurely.
