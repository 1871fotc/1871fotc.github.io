Following the opening of the Brisbane General Cemetery of Toowong in 1875, the seven sectarian cemeteries were gradually abandoned. By the end of the 19<sup>th</sup> century, the site had fallen into a state of disrepair. A decision was made in 1911 to have the Paddington Cemetery converted to public parklands. The memorials were subsequently removed and the opportunity was provided to relatives to relocate the remains and or memorials to other cemeteries including Toowong.

This movement culminated in a public meeting on 10 January 1916 at Brisbane's Exhibition Hall which voted to establish the Anzac Day Commemoration Committee of Queensland, with chaplain Lieutenant-Colonel Garland its secretary. </p> <p>Garland's contribution to Anzac Day tradition was to devise ecumenical or secular rituals for public commemoration of those who died in battle and and to comfort the bereaved. Because his format was non-denominational, everyone could participate, regardless of their faith tradition. The minute's silence provided a space for all Australian's and New Zealanders to demonstrate respect for The Fallen of the Great War. </p> <p>In 1916 Garland initiated a trust to receive money raised from the sale of silk, lavender-coloured badges embossed with gold leaf with the lion of St Mark and the motto \"Their Name Liveth for Evermore\". These became the first Anzac Day badges, initially earmarked to pay for the upkeep of soldiers' graves at home and abroad. The appeal eventually helped fund soldier respite hostels and memorials to be established. </p> <p>On the morning of Anzac Day 1920, the first since his return from war service, Garland visited \"Soldiers' Corner\" at Toowong Cemetery and found friends and families of the deceased paying their respects. Noting people of all religions were present, he asked all to observe a minutes' silence rather than offer up prayers during an impromptu commemoration service. </p> <p>Under the guidance of Garland the Anzac Day service at Toowong Cemetery grew in size and significance as did the badge-selling campaign which supported the Lady Mayoress's committee. The campaign's success helped fund the establishment of the \"Cross of Sacrifice\" and \"The Stone of Remembrance\" which were erected and unveiled in 1924 near the entrance to Toowong Cemetery immediately adjacent to Canon Garland Place. Anzac Day commemorations in Brisbane where held here until the Anzac Memorial - Shrine of Remembrance - in Anzac Square, was completed in 1930.</p> <p>Garland, aged 75, died at Red Hill on 11 October 1939.

Its contour site and surroundings certainly make it one of the most picturesque capitals in the Southern Hemisphere. Twenty miles of a noble winding river from Oxley to Pinkenba; the well-defined inner suburbs crowded with attractive residences; the rapidly expanding environs spreading over countless charming slopes marked by spacious roads and decorated with handsome villas; the City itself humming with traffic and business and far outgrowing the early plans of its founders; the hills and dales, parks and squares, imperial spires and substantially built warehouses, broad river\u2011reaches and stately ocean liners \u2014 all enter into a succession of magnificent pictures that are photographed on the observant mind as a joy for ever.</p> <p>Brisbane's old cemetery used to be situated in the once restful hollow between Petrie Terrace and Paddington Hill. There in that now almost forgotten God's acre sleep many who saw the struggling scattered settlement at Moreton Bay in the 'fifties, 'sixties, and 'seventies. A pathetic interest attaches to the spot. As Brisbane grew, this old cemetery soon became full. With the selection of new burial grounds and the passing of years the place suffered from neglect. Fences fell down and a few unkempt paths, voiceless mounds, and weathered and leaning headstones with short inscriptions scarcely decipherable, were all that was left to record the passing of many a sturdy pioneer and worthy citizen. In quite recent years the land on the left of the Paddington tramline has been transformed into a sports oval; while the opposite side has been metamorphosed into a children's recreation ground, and what the poet Gordon wished has been almost realised in cold fact:</p> <p>\"Let me slumber in the hollow where the wattle blossoms wave,  With never stone or rail to fence my bed;  Should the sturdy station children pull the bush flowers on my grave,  I may chance to hear them romping overhead.\"</p> <p></p> <p>\"I shall pass this way but once. If therefore there be any kindness I can show, or any good thing I can do, let me do it now; let me not defer it nor neglect it, for I shall not pass this way again.\" \u2014 Stephen Grellett.</p> <p>new-building.jpeg</p> <p>offices-and-flower-shed.jpeg</p> <p>When the Paddington Cemetery was removed, a special Act of Parliament was passed which enabled the Trustees to make arrangements by which, on the application of relatives, the remains of persons long deceased were exhumed from the old Cemetery and re\u2011buried in the new, and the old headstones were also cleaned, re\u2011lettered, and removed free of expense to present relatives.</p> <p>The Brisbane General Cemetery includes an area of approximately 122\u00bd acres and is situated at Toowong, about 4\u00bd miles from the General Post Office. It is easily reached by tram, train or motor car. The original area of the reserve was 248 acres 3 roods 22 perches. Of this an area of 40 acres was at first definitely set aside and fenced for cemetery purposes. Toowong Park Act of 1915 the Legislature enabled and authorised the Trustees to transfer 132 acres to the Toowong Town Council for park purposes, the proceeds of the transfer being devoted to the erection of Cemetery wall, iron railings and gates. By the purchase and enclosure of 6\u00bd acres of other land the Trustees were enabled to ensure that the total area of the Cemetery was completely surrounded by public roads.</p> <p>Except for its nearness to the fast spreading city no better ground for variety of contour, accessibility, convenience of area, and excellence of drainage could have been chosen for the General Cemetery than the site at Toowong. Oversea visitors frequently admire the natural beauty of its position and describe it as one of the prettiest cemeteries in the world. A frequent tram service (3d. from the city) runs past the grounds and the gates are but a ten minutes' walk from the Toowong Railway Station. Here in many a height and hollow sleep the remains of Brisbane's silent hundreds. The extensive grounds are well planned out and are gradually being transformed into a scene of beauty in keeping with the associations and purposes of the Trust. Monuments of past Governors of Queensland and of distinguished citizens tower amid the thousands of humbler stones that rise from the flowered slopes. The development of the Cemetery area can only be made slowly as there is no endowment to the Trust, and the steady policy of the Trustees is to keep the Cemetery fees and charges as reasonable as possible in the public interest. The annual margin of credit is not large, but with judicious management the Trustees are able to carry out gradually a well defined plan of improvement.</p>"},{"location":"about/brisbane-general-cemetery-handbook-1924/#other-cemeteries","title":"Other Cemeteries.","text":"<p>South Brisbane Cemetery, Boggo Road.\u2014 Gladstone Road tram from North Quay to Cemetery gates (3d. fare).

William Henry Browne's memorial was unveiled on April 30th, 1905, a squad of twelve police were present to protect the surrounding railings and tombstones.</p> <p>In December, 1907, a Sectional Register from earliest records to date was made at a cost of \u00a350.</p> <p>Considerable improvements to the grounds were effected in 1908; fences and out-buildings were repaired, and trees removed.</p> <p>Fees were increased as in Government Gazette of December 25th, 1909.</p> <p>New Rules and Regulations appeared in Government Gazette of 4th April, 1910.</p> <p>In 1913 The Cremation Act came into force, but has so far proved inoperative. A Cremation Society of Brisbane had conference with Trustees, and negotiations were carried on, and a choice of three sites had been offered. No cremating has yet taken place in Queensland. No Crematorium has yet been established.</p> <p>In 1914 the Trustees consented to the transfer of part of their ground, known as the Old Rifle Range, to the Toowong Town Council, for the sum of \u00a31000 and the right to obtain top-dressing materials from a specified area. The land was originally 257 acres; 8 were needed for streets, 100 were utilised as cemetery, 15 were used as sites for cottages and offices, and 134 was known as the Rifle Range. The Toowong Park Act was passed on November 15th, 1915. Shortly afterwards the money was paid and the transfer was effected.</p> <p>In April, 1916, the Trustees purchased 6\u00bd acres contiguous to the present grounds at \u00a330 an acre, thus completing a convenient cemetery acreage, entirely surrounded by public roads.</p> <p>In 1916 the Brisbane Tramways Company Ltd. erected a shelter shed.</p> <p>New Rules and Regulations were gazetted 9th January, 1917.</p> <p>The Stone of Remembrance was unveiled by His Excellency the Governor-General of the Commonwealth on Anzac Day (April 25th), 1924. witnessed by a large multitude. It was a most impressive ceremony, the land on which the Cross of Sacrifice and Stone of Remembrance are erected is one of the most conspicuous and picturesque spots in the Cemetery, and was donated by the Trustees to the Anzac Memorial Committee. (Photo p. 10)</p> <p>The new building was completed in 1924</p> <p>The Trustees' policy throughout has been to keep down all fees and charges to a reasonable scale compatible with the growth of the city, the desire for extensions, and the need for gradual improvements. A very useful building has now been erected (see photo. page 4) making provision for Cemetery office, tool room and lockers, lavatories, retiring rooms, dining room with gas jet, shower, etc., for convenience of the staff.</p> <p>Included in the plans for future development (when finances allow) is the erection of a mortuary chapel, a possible crematorium, the erection of more suitable walls, fencing and entrances, the planting of trees, and an extension of the system by which in return for the payment of a lump sum the Trustees undertake the upkeep and tendance of any grave.</p> <p>john-melville.jpeg</p> <p>j-l-melville.jpeg</p>"},{"location":"about/brisbane-general-cemetery-handbook-1924/#garden","title":"Garden","text":"<p>For some years the cultivation of flowers within the Cemetery grounds has been a special feature.

Toowong Cemetery is the largest in Queensland and is an important record of the history of Brisbane and Queensland.</p> <p>At the end of the convict period the main cemetery was near the northern end of the present William Jolly Bridge. In 1844 the Paddington Cemetery (on the site of the current Suncorp Stadium at Lang Park) came into use. This cemetery quickly became overcrowded. As early as 1853 a petition requesting a new general cemetery was sent to the Government of New South Wales, of which Queensland was then a part.</p> <p>In June 1866 a site of 203 acres at the base of One Tree Hill (now Mt Coot\u2011tha) about 6 kilometres from the centre of Brisbane was surveyed for a cemetery reserve. This was extended to 257 acres in October 1870.</p> <p>Queensland's second Governor, Colonel Samuel Blackall, was ill and this prompted him to choose a plot the highest in the cemetery - for his grave. He died in January 1871 and was the first to be buried in the new cemetery. His impressive memorial continues to dominate the hill.</p> <p>Trustees were appointed to administer the cemetery in October 1871. The inhabitants of Brisbane were reluctant to use the new cemetery because of the lack of public transport and resultant higher funeral costs. In 1875 the railway was extended through to Toowong and the cemetery was officially opened on the 5<sup>th</sup> of July 1875.</p> <p>Although Governor Blackall was the first person buried in Toowong Cemetery, several memorials predate his grave. In 1881 the bodies of three children who died in the early 1830s (their fathers were guards in the convict settlement) were exhumed from a North Quay site and, with the original headstones, transferred to Toowong Cemetery. Around 1911 a small number of remains and memorials from the Paddington Cemetery were also removed to Toowong Cemetery.</p> <p>In 1915 a parcel of 132 acres was transferred to the Toowong Town Council to provide parkland and the proceeds used for the erection of a cemetery wall, iron railing and gates. In 1930 the administration of the cemetery was handed over by the trustees to the newly formed Brisbane City Council.</p> <p>By April 1975 almost all available plots in Toowong Cemetery had been sold but burials still take place in family graves. More new graves were made available in January 1999.</p> <p>It is estimated that around 116,000 are buried in Toowong Cemetery. While there is a large amount of information available on a small number of very notable individuals, little is known about the majority of the people buried at Toowong. These are the 'ordinary people'. Every one has an 'extraordinary story'.

Born in Bathurst, Susannah was the eldest of six children. Susannah's father, William Nathaniel Kable, died when she was eleven. Her mother, Elizabeth, remarried and with her new husband, Matthew Smith Finley, had another five children.</p> <p>When Susannah was about six and living in Bathurst, her mother Elizabeth went one night to investigate an intruder in their house. An escaped convict was hiding in the bedroom. Taking the only weapon at hand, a small cobbler's hammer, Elizabeth levelled it at the intruder as if it was a pistol, saying \"If you move, I'll fire.\" While covering the man with the hammer, she managed to attract the attention of a household servant. When the escapee found that he had been taken by a woman with a hammer, he vowed vengeance. The family lived in fear of his escaping again until he was sent to Cockatoo Island for a lengthy sentence.</p> <p>When Susannah was 19, she married John Shand Maclean, the son of a Equity Court judge in Jamaica. John had arrived in Australia seven years earlier in 1838. The first of Susannah's ten children was born in 1847. Susannah followed her husband around as he pursued his various interests. John attempted farming and for a time taught at a gentlemen's academy in the Richmond area of New South she gave Wales. </p> <p>Susannah was in Bathurst in 1853, where she gave birth to her third son. By 1856, where the ever-growing family had settled in the Burnett region of Queensland. Susannah's final four children were born on various cattle properties in the Burnett region.</p> <p>Susannah struggled to raise her growing family with only the occasional help of indifferent servants. She was often left alone in the unlined slab house. At times Susannah would see eyes peering at her through the cracks. To ward them off, she would take a firearm from the rack and handle it as if she was about to use it. Her ruse appeared to have worked.</p> <p>Tragedy struck in November 1862 when John fell off a horse and died on Gyandrah Station near Cracow, Queensland. Susannah was left with ten children under the age of fifteen and a cattle property to manage. She suffered another setback in the 1870s when a fire swept through Gyandrah, destroying all her photographs and heirlooms.</p> <p>Susannah brought up her large family with the assistance of her brother and sister-in-law on a nearby property. The children learnt to swim in the Dawson River and reputedly all became expert riders.</p> <p>In 1884 Susannah's youngest child, Eric, married sixteen-year-old Elizabeth Penhallurick at her residence at Westwood, via Rockhampton. From about this time, Mrs Agnes Maclean, as she became known, developed a reputation as a midwife, delivering many children in district, including a number of her own grandchildren. In October 1893, Agnes delivered Elizabeth's second son at Westwood. While Eric and Elizabeth had moved north to Bowen by 1895, it seems that Agnes moved south.</p> <p>Agnes claimed the right to vote in 1905, her 80<sup>th</sup> year. She was registered on the electoral rolls as living with her youngest daughter, Elvina, and her schoolmaster husband, Charles Marshall, at the Nerang State School.</p> <p>Agnes died of nephritis at the Nerang Hospital on the 20<sup>th</sup> of January 1911. She was buried at Toowong Cemetery next to her sister-in-law, Mary Ann Kable.</p> <p>The grave of Agnes Susan Maclean was restored in 1998 with funds provided by the Kable family.</p>"},{"location":"about/extraordinary-stories/#acknowledgement","title":"Acknowledgement","text":"<p>This story was contributed by Wendy O'Brien.</p>"},{"location":"about/extraordinary-stories/#jessie-massy-181168","title":"Jessie Massy (18\u2011116\u20118)","text":"<p>The ninth and youngest child of James Hall-Scott and Sarah Ross, Jessie was born at Ross Hall, Bowen on the 5<sup>th</sup> of March 1874.

He was the third surviving son of Charles Alphonse Massy, who had four sons and two daughters, all of whom were born at Gundaroo, New South Wales.</p> <p>Glenville was educated at the Collegiate School, Glebe Point, Sydney, where he studied until he turned seventeen. Owing to an indifferent state of health he did not immediately engage in any particular occupation.</p> <p>A year later, in 1881, he came to Queensland to join his brothers, Charles and Oscar, at Sonoma, a cattle property owned by them near Bowen. He remained on Sonoma for about a year, when, with Charles, he started with a 1000 head of breeders with the view of taking up land on the Lynd, a river which junctions with the Mitchell. On their arrival, however, they learned that the country had already been selected. Their next thought was to obtain pasture for their herd during the advancing wet season.</p> <p>Glenville stayed with the cattle while Charles inspected down the Mitchell and Palmer Rivers and over the Straaten River Valley, becoming familiar with the the country and potential for grazing. When the roads were again traversable, the brothers mustered their stock and continued their journey to the far north, eventually arriving at the Stuart River, where they took up country 1200 kilometres from where they had started. This land was now known as Silver Plains. Its ownership passed to the Queensland Government after the Massys abandoned it when they acquired better country to the west-north-west and moved their stock there. To this property, Rokeby, they devoted many strenuous years. Living 160 kilometres from their nearest neighbour, lacking postal and telegraphic facilities, their only means of procuring stores was by packhorse from Cooktown, a distance of 360 kilometres, at a cost of \u00a335 per ton. They sturdily faced floods and droughts and the many indescribable hardships accompanying such events. There was practically no market for their stock and for several years it was impossible to obtain credit from financial institutions.</p> <p>The Aboriginals constantly killed and harassed the stock and menaced the lives of the settlers. In the efforts of the brothers to halt the attacks by dispersing the Aboriginals, Charles was wounded by a barbed spear which entered his back and became embedded. Glenville helped his older brother to travel over 190 kilometres, but shortly after reaching medical aid Charles died of exhaustion.</p> <p>Oscar joined Glenville at Rokeby. To make it cheaper and quicker to bring in supplies, the Massy brothers pushed a road through to the mouth of the Stuart River. Stores were then transported by sea from Cooktown and then by pack horse at the much reduced rate of \u00a310 per ton. The Queensland Government also used the road for forwarding supplies when building the overland telegraph line to Cape York.</p> <p>When by 1895 it was imperative to find a market for their increasing herd, Glenville moved to Thursday Island and established a butchering business, which he conducted on his own for the following 14 years as a means of absorbing the Rokeby stock. Then the butchering business was floated into a limited company with the title of \"The Torres Straits Fresh Food and Ice Company\", in which Glenville retained an interest for several years.</p> <p>In the meantime the firm acquired Emu Plains, a run adjoining the original Sonoma property. The Massy brothers mutually decided to dissolve the partnership in 1910, Glenville becoming the sole owner of Rokeby and Emu Plains while retaining an interest in Sonoma, which was then administered by Oscar.</p> <p>That year Glenville Massy retired from North Queensland and took up residence at Glenville, on the corner of Milton Road and Hobbs Street, Auchenflower. The house, described as one of the most fashionable of its time, is no longer standing. Glenville spent his days amid comforts which vividly contrast with the frequent privations - such as scarcity of water and lack of food for days at a time - and the many other hardships incidental to a life in the Peninsula.</p> <p>He married Jessie, daughter of James Hall-Scott, a pioneer of the Bowen district in 1897. Jessie's story is told elsewhere.

They both came from farming families and are believed to have married in Goteborg on the 7<sup>th</sup> of January 1870. A son, Carl, was born to them in Sweden later that year. </p> <p>The 1870s were a time of acute distress in Sweden as the result of overpopulation and poor farm production and during that period almost one million people emigrated. Most went to the USA but quite a number came to Australia.</p> <p>In October 1872, Anders, Emma and toddler Carl departed from Sweden and sailed for Queensland in the ship Lammershagen.</p> <p>The Lammershagen was a German immigrant ship which sailed from Hamburg with a migrant complement of 112 married adults, 116 single males, 76 single females and 67 children. The passengers were principally Swedish, Danish, Norwegian and German farming people, most of whom were assisted migrants whose fares were either subsidised or fully paid for by the Queensland Colonial Government. </p> <p>The voyage to Australia was a long and bitter experience. In line with the practice of the times, each passenger was allowed a ration of very basic food daily and it was a requirement that each bring several changes of clothing as laundering was permitted only at ports of call during the trip. Thirteen passengers died and 17 children were born during the voyage. Young Carl was one of those who died. He was buried at sea.</p> <p>On arrival in Australian waters, an outbreak of typhoid occurred among the passengers and crew, which resulted in the ship being placed in quarantine at Peel Island, Moreton Bay on the 9<sup>th</sup> of January, 1873. It was during the quarantine period that a second child, Anna Caroline, was born on the 21<sup>st</sup> of January 1873. The ship was finally allowed to berth in the Port of Brisbane on the 12<sup>th</sup> of February 1873 and the migrant passengers were placed in a hostel at Kangaroo Point, where the family stayed for several weeks.</p> <p>Anders first worked for wages on a farm at Bald Hills and then went to a farm owned by a Mr Robinson on the South Pine River. It was on this farm that the Aboriginals helped them strip bark from trees to roof their house and cow bails. Quite often the Aboriginals came to the house for tobacco and flour. Later Anders leased a small farm in an area bounded by Albany Creek Road,wherehe ran the first cattle he owned. In 1889 he leased a further 37 acres situated on the South Pine River at Cash's Crossing.</p> <p>In those times, about once per month the family harnessed the sulky or their wagon and drove into the city of Brisbane with dressed pigs and calves for sale to an Adelaide Street butcher and produce which was sold at the markets which then stood in Roma Street.</p> <p>Anders purchased a farm at Samford in October 1893. The area consisted of approximately 120 hectares. He borrowed about a third of the purchase price. By now, eleven children had been born to the family of whom nine survived infancy. The family initially lived in a slab hut but in 1900 a new house was built, financed by the sale of some of the land.</p> <p>While the farm was only 24 kilometres from Brisbane, trips to town by sulky or wagon were somewhat of an expedition, entailing a 3am start and a return late at night. Occasionally an overnight stay at a city boarding house was necessary.</p> <p>Anders and Emma were pillars of the local Methodist church, subscribing to have a new church built about 100 metres from their home. The church was known as the Cedar Creek Methodist Church. The parson would drive his sulky there from Enoggera. The parson would stay the weekend with the Petersen-Neilsens while he conducted services in the church and visited the local parishioners. After Anders and Emma retired to Brisbane, the farm passed into the hands of their son. The weekend visits of the parson to the farm did not thrill the younger members of the family to the same extent and eventually Frederick gave rather generously to have the church removed to Samford township.</p> <p>When Anders sold the farm to Frederick on the 4<sup>th</sup> of May 1915, he and Emma were 72. They moved to Paddington, next door to their daughter Emily. Emma died at the age of 82 years on the 27<sup>th</sup> of January 1925 and Anders died on the 10<sup>th</sup> of May 1928 aged 85.</p>"},{"location":"about/extraordinary-stories/#acknowledgement_13","title":"Acknowledgement","text":"<p>This story was contributed by Gordon Neilson.</p>"},{"location":"about/extraordinary-stories/#joseph-needham-scrope-shrapnel-1681415","title":"Joseph Needham Scrope Shrapnel (1\u201168\u201114/15)","text":"<p>Joseph Needham Scrope Shrapnel migrated from England in 1870 on the ship Beaumaris Castle with a lady whom family members long believed to be his wife.

In 1857 George arrived in Moreton Bay with his parents and sister, older siblings having migrated two years earlier. Their religion was Presbyterian but evidently they were not teetotallers for George was a winemaker and his brother John, who settled at Killarney, south-east Queensland, made wine and had a brandy distillery.</p> <p>The George Affleck family settled at Toolburra, eleven kilometres north-west of Warwick, where they built a homestead they named Riverside on the banks of the Condamine River, a small stream at this point. The old home was moved some years ago so that today's only visible connection is nearby Affleck Bridge. The Afflecks were listed as graziers but as well as running sheep they also grew grain crops and had a herd of dairy cattle, and as a family we recounted among the pioneers of the district. The Affleck clan became the largest landholders in the district, going on to be involved in state politics.</p> <p>In 1867 George Affleck married Alice Moffat Skeldon, who was born in Edinburgh in 1845, arriving in Australia aged nine. Alice went to the Warwick district in 1866 and was probably distantly related to the Afflecks. George and Alice had nine children, the eldest being William James Affleck, born on the 22<sup>nd</sup> of June 1868. When he was six he was enrolled at the local Sandy Creek school, which had opened in 1872. When his primary schooling was completed, William, who was said to an excellent pupil, was sent to Brisbane to attend the Normal School. On completion of his schooling in 1885 William, aged seventeen, obtained a job as a junior clerk with the life insurance company The National Mutual Life Association of Australasia Limited, which had opened its Brisbane branch in 1881. His pay was $90 per annum.</p> <p>On the 13<sup>th</sup> of July 1893 William James Affleck married Maud Voller Lade. They had three children, two daughters and a son.</p> <p>From his humble beginning with The National Mutual in Queensland William James Affleck worked his way to the top after administrative postings in Bowen and Townsville, and then back in Brisbane. He became manager for Queensland in 1919, retaining this position with distinction until his death while on sick leave in 1932 at the age of 64. Other Afflecks had died at an even earlier age suffering from heart disease, the cause of William James Affleck's death.</p> <p>Throughout his life Affleck had retained his links with the land by interesting himself in community affairs and being actively involved with the Royal National Agricultural and Industrial Society, the RNA, when he returned to Brisbane in 1902, from his Townsville posting. He loved horses and in his early working life he rode long distances while on insurance business. In Townsville he had been active in the local agricultural show as well as horse shows.</p> <p>When the family returned to Brisbane in 1902 they rented a house for a short time before settling at 19 Vulture Street, West End, the land running back to Ashington Street. The roomy house stood on one block and the garden and outbuildings occupied three other blocks. Here on the back boundary there were stables where the horses and buggies were kept. The elder daughter Vera learned to ride when quite young, a Shetland pony having been bought for her. Vera rode to school, leaving her horse at the livery stables near where today's City Hall stands. Her father drove his horse and buggy to his city office, one of the clerks then taking the outfit to the same stables.</p> <p>After holding various honorary positions in the RNA in Brisbane, W.J. Affleck became president of this association and was also president of the Stockbreeders' Association of Queensland, the Jersey Cattle Society of Queensland and the Ayrshire Society. Such was Affleck's interest in cattle he was also treasurer of the Hereford Society. He judged cattle and established herd books and half a dozen Herd Book Societies. A building at the Brisbane Exhibition Ground was called Affleck House in his honour.</p> <p>W. J. Affleck was a tall man who held himself erect. He had a commanding presence and a soft heart with a reputation for giving hand-outs to men in need during the Great Depression. He always wore a button-hole and carried a walking stick whether in city circles or in the countryside he loved.</p> <p>As well as Affleck's interest in agricultural matters he was a justice of the peace, a founding Rotarian in Brisbane, and a member and office bearer of the Auchenflower Bowling Club. When Affleck died, it was noted in the newspaper obituaries that he was one of Queensland's most public spirited men.</p>"},{"location":"about/extraordinary-stories/#acknowledgement_16","title":"Acknowledgement","text":"<p>This story was contributed by Shirley Lahey.</p>"},{"location":"about/extraordinary-stories/#maud-voller-affleck-84914","title":"Maud Voller Affleck (8\u201149\u201114)","text":"<p>Maud Voller Lade was born on the 2<sup>nd</sup> of June 1874 in Brisbane, the third of the eight children of Joseph John Lade and Mary nee Bridges, both English-born. Joseph's parents, Thomas Lade and his wife Harriet left the farms that he had managed in Kent and sailed with their three children to Moreton Bay in 1851. Their passage to Sydney on the sailing ship Windsor cost $120 in today's money. The Lades settled at Upper Kedron Brook on land Thomas bought for $124 in the suburb now known as Enoggera. They called their new farm and homestead Surrenden after the property they had lived on in Kent.</p> <p>The hard-working Lades prospered as farmers and fruitgrowers and Thomas Lade won prizes in the first Moreton Bay Horticultural Society's show in 1853. He, with the assistance of his son Joseph, were to distinguish themselves by becoming Queensland's first commercial wine producers and in 1862 Thomas Lade won a medal and certificate of honourable mention at the London International Exhibition. The Lades were considered to be the best authorities on wine culture in the colony.</p> <p>The Lades were devout Baptists. They had been closely involved with their church in Kent and in Brisbane they were foundation members of the Wharf Street Baptist Church.</p> <p>When Joseph married in 1869 he and his wife Mary moved further out on Sanford Road to a farm they called Glen Retreat. Joseph Lade late in life wrote that his family had bought this land in 1851 when Surrenden was purchased but there is evidence to support this date of purchase. Here Joseph planted fruit trees and grapevines while Mary managed a boot and shoe shop on the corner of George and Queen Streets. Mary appears to have been the one with the business head while Joseph was somewhat of a dreamer. As well as managing the city shop Mary bought houses, did them up and sold them.</p> <p>In the year or two before Joseph and Mary Lade's third child was born in 1874, Joseph wanted to increase the number of his citrus trees so he purchased and then planted seeds of oranges and mandarins. One of the latter seedlings had a distinct foliage and went on to produce a high quality fruit that became known as the Beauty of Glen Retreat mandarin, later shortened to Glen Retreat mandarin. However, its commercial success did not come until Lade had sold the Glen Retreat farm to a Mr W. H. Parker around the turn of the century. Parker actively marketed the fruit and by 1927 this mandarin had world-wide distribution.</p> <p>Little is known of Maud's childhood but she did attend the Normal School in Brisbane. She had a lively intelligence and was quick witted and humorous. Six weeks after her nineteenth birthday Maud married William James Affleck on the 13th of July 1893. Some of the manchester in her trousseau she bought at reduced prices as it was flood damaged. This was an aftermath of the great flood that had occurred earlier that year.</p> <p>William and Maud had three children, two daughters Alice Vera and Marjory, and a son Kenneth George, and four grandchildren. The marriage was a happy one.</p> <p>William died in 1932. He had been manager for Queensland of the National Mutual Life Association of Australia, but these were the days before life insurance offices paid generous pensions to the widows of staff officers. Maud endured some financial difficulties during her 33 years of widowhood.</p> <p>She lived in the large house called Ayethorne at Vulture Street, West End from the time the family returned to Brisbane from Townsville in 1902 until her death more than 60 years later. In her widowhood she let the downstairs area as a self-contained flat, and upstairs took in two paying guests to supplement her income.</p> <p>Maud professed to know little of her forebears, though the Lades had lived in Kent for many centuries. Some of the family had lived at Eyethorne, Kent, the name of the West End house apparently being a mis-spelling of the Kentish village.

Born in Bathurst, Susannah was the eldest of six children. Susannah's father, William Nathaniel Kable, died when she was eleven. Her mother, Elizabeth, remarried and with her new husband, Matthew Smith Finley, had another five children.</p> <p>When Susannah was about six and living in Bathurst, her mother Elizabeth went one night to investigate an intruder in their house. An escaped convict was hiding in the bedroom. Taking the only weapon at hand, a small cobbler's hammer, Elizabeth levelled it at the intruder as if it was a pistol, saying \"If you move, I'll fire.\" While covering the man with the hammer, she managed to attract the attention of a household servant. When the escapee found that he had been taken by a woman with a hammer, he vowed vengeance. The family lived in fear of his escaping again until he was sent to Cockatoo Island for a lengthy sentence.</p> <p>When Susannah was 19, she married John Shand Maclean, the son of a Equity Court judge in Jamaica. John had arrived in Australia seven years earlier in 1838. The first of Susannah's ten children was born in 1847. Susannah followed her husband around as he pursued his various interests. John attempted farming and for a time taught at a gentlemen's academy in the Richmond area of New South she gave Wales. </p> <p>Susannah was in Bathurst in 1853, where she gave birth to her third son. By 1856, where the ever-growing family had settled in the Burnett region of Queensland. Susannah's final four children were born on various cattle properties in the Burnett region.</p> <p>Susannah struggled to raise her growing family with only the occasional help of indifferent servants. She was often left alone in the unlined slab house. At times Susannah would see eyes peering at her through the cracks. To ward them off, she would take a firearm from the rack and handle it as if she was about to use it. Her ruse appeared to have worked.</p> <p>Tragedy struck in November 1862 when John fell off a horse and died on Gyandrah Station near Cracow, Queensland. Susannah was left with ten children under the age of fifteen and a cattle property to manage. She suffered another setback in the 1870s when a fire swept through Gyandrah, destroying all her photographs and heirlooms.</p> <p>Susannah brought up her large family with the assistance of her brother and sister-in-law on a nearby property. The children learnt to swim in the Dawson River and reputedly all became expert riders.</p> <p>In 1884 Susannah's youngest child, Eric, married sixteen-year-old Elizabeth Penhallurick at her residence at Westwood, via Rockhampton. From about this time, Mrs Agnes Maclean, as she became known, developed a reputation as a midwife, delivering many children in district, including a number of her own grandchildren. In October 1893, Agnes delivered Elizabeth's second son at Westwood. While Eric and Elizabeth had moved north to Bowen by 1895, it seems that Agnes moved south.</p> <p>Agnes claimed the right to vote in 1905, her 80<sup>th</sup> year. She was registered on the electoral rolls as living with her youngest daughter, Elvina, and her schoolmaster husband, Charles Marshall, at the Nerang State School.</p> <p>Agnes died of nephritis at the Nerang Hospital on the 20<sup>th</sup> of January 1911.

It tells of parties of drovers who would set out from the cattle fattening yards which used to stretch from the foot of Mt Coot\u2011tha to the Brisbane river. They would proceed in stages to the North West, where they would collect a vast herd of beef cattle and bring them here for spelling and fattening. Another name by which this ballad was known is \"Brisbane Ladies\". One version of the song suggested that these ladies camped in the drovers' rough huts in which they stayed between their trips to the cattle country, and provided \"home comforts\", including cooking, to the travel\u2011weary stockmen.</p> <p></p> <p>Add to this Story </p>"},{"location":"research/boyd-dunlop-morehead/","title":"Boyd Dunlop Morehead","text":""},{"location":"research/boyd-dunlop-morehead/#boyd-dunlop-morehead","title":"Boyd Dunlop Morehead","text":"<p>24 August 1843 \u2014 30 October 1905</p>"},{"location":"research/boyd-dunlop-morehead/#boyd-dunlop-morehead-12496","title":"Boyd Dunlop Morehead (12\u201149\u20116)","text":"<p>Boyd Dunlop Morehead was Queensland Premier from 30 November 1888 to 12 August 1890.

Until his death, Freeleagus remained Managing Director of what became one of the state's biggest wholesale and retail food chains, providing the first employment over the years for hundreds of Greek migrants.</p> <p>Freeleagus was passionate about his homeland and worked continuously to make his Greek heritage better known and respected among Australians. As a result, Freeleagus was appointed Greek Consul\u2011General, the first of that rank any country had appointed. </p> <p>Despite his involvement in the Greek Military and service during the Greek\u2011Turkish War, Freeleagus continued to urge migration to Australia, and on 22 May 1922 delivered a lecture on Australia to the Athens Literary Society, a copy of which is held in the National Library of Greece. In Australia however, his patriotism for his country never ceased and after the Italian attack on Greece during World War II, he led a number of funding appeals, leading to the highly successful Greek Day on 19 November 1941. For this work he was awarded the Silver Cross of George I. He later received the Gold Cross in 1951. Freeleagus continued this type of fundraising for his community at home in Greece throughout his life and an appeal for victims of the 1953 earthquake in western Greece raised the largest amount of money ever sent from Australia for its time.</p> <p>Members of the Greek community continued to arrive in Queensland and with support and encouragement from Freeleagus began moving outside Brisbane. As a result, strong Greek communities were formed in Biloela and Home Hill during the 1920s and 1930s. A high\u2011ranking freemason, Freeleagus helped found the Royal Automobile Club of Queensland and became a leader of the Chamber of Commerce. </p> <p>When Freeleagus died of a heart attack on 16 May 1957, he had successfully founded the first Greek Association and his prominence in the religious and political life of the Greek community was evident through his community\u2019s large attendance at his funeral.</p> <p> </p> <p>Christy Freeleagus, wearing the Greek army uniform, ca. 1922 \u2014 State Library of Queensland.  </p> <p></p> <p>Add to this Story </p>"},{"location":"research/constance-campbell/","title":"Constance Campbell","text":""},{"location":"research/constance-campbell/#constance-campbell","title":"Constance Campbell","text":"<p>16 December 1872 \u2014 4 July 1926</p> <p></p> <p>Add to this Story </p>"},{"location":"research/daniel-george-bloomfield/","title":"Daniel George Bloomfield","text":""},{"location":"research/daniel-george-bloomfield/#daniel-george-bloomfield","title":"Daniel George Bloomfield","text":"<p>1858 \u2014 1915</p>"},{"location":"research/daniel-george-bloomfield/#daniel-george-bloomfield-510111","title":"Daniel George Bloomfield (5\u2011101\u201111)","text":"<p>Daniel Bloomfield (1858-1915) was, for many years, a well known bandmaster and popular cornet soloist in Brisbane.

He then energetically tried to replicate the movement in New Zealand. </p> <p>With Australia and New Zealand at war with the German Empire, Garland was recalled to Brisbane in 1915 and tasked with providing and coordinating chaplaincy and welfare services at Enoggera Army Base to thousands of fresh recruits. </p> <p>In the wake of climbing casualty lists and community grief, he urged legislators to establish a framework to enable the nation to publicly honour the service and sacrifice of Australian and New Zealand troops killed in the Gallipoli Peninsula landings of 25 April 1915. This movement culminated in a public meeting on 10 January 1916 at Brisbane's Exhibition Hall which voted to establish the Anzac Day Commemoration Committee of Queensland, with chaplain Lieutenant-Colonel Garland its secretary. </p> <p>Garland's contribution to Anzac Day tradition was to devise ecumenical or secular rituals for public commemoration of those who died in battle and and to comfort the bereaved. Because his format was non-denominational, everyone could participate, regardless of their faith tradition. The minute's silence provided a space for all Australian's and New Zealanders to demonstrate respect for The Fallen of the Great War. </p> <p>In 1916 Garland initiated a trust to receive money raised from the sale of silk, lavender-coloured badges embossed with gold leaf with the lion of St Mark and the motto \"Their Name Liveth for Evermore\". These became the first Anzac Day badges, initially earmarked to pay for the upkeep of soldiers' graves at home and abroad. The appeal eventually helped fund soldier respite hostels and memorials to be established. </p> <p>On the morning of Anzac Day 1920, the first since his return from war service, Garland visited \"Soldiers' Corner\" at Toowong Cemetery and found friends and families of the deceased paying their respects. Noting people of all religions were present, he asked all to observe a minutes' silence rather than offer up prayers during an impromptu commemoration service. </p> <p>Under the guidance of Garland the Anzac Day service at Toowong Cemetery grew in size and significance as did the badge-selling campaign which supported the Lady Mayoress's committee. The campaign's success helped fund the establishment of the \"Cross of Sacrifice\" and \"The Stone of Remembrance\" which were erected and unveiled in 1924 near the entrance to Toowong Cemetery immediately adjacent to Canon Garland Place. Anzac Day commemoration's in Brisbane where held here until the Anzac Memorial - Shrine of Remembrance - in Anzac Square, was completed in 1930.</p> <p>Garland officiated many funerals at Toowong Cemetery from 1910 onwards, including those for a significant number of returned servicemen of World War 1.

Orphaned when young, Florence became the ward of a relation at Torquay, Devon. Despite her extremely delicate constitution and near\u2011blindness, she devoted herself as a young woman to both practical charity and prayer. After a physical breakdown in 1887, she accompanied her two brothers to Bundaberg, Queensland, where they purchased Oakwood, a substantial cane\u2011farm. Seriously injured in a riding accident in 1888, she was left permanently crippled. After teaching her Melanesian servants English and Bible stories, she later assumed responsibility for the non\u2011denominational South Seas Evangelical Mission (also known as the Queensland Kanaka Mission). In addition she served as Queensland secretary of both the International Scripture Union and the Young Women's Christian Association, and maintained at her own expense a hostel for English migrant girls.</p> <p>After Oakwood was destroyed in the 1893 floods, Florence Buchanan lived at Townsville and competently helped Bishop C. G. Barlow to administer his diocese. Two years later she worked among the multi\u2011racial communities of divers on Thursday Island. Forced to go to London for surgery, on her return she met Kashiwagi Taira, an educated storekeeper who introduced her into the usually closed Japanese community. Though only modestly successful in proselytizing them, she was revered and respected by everybody on the island for her generous hospitality, friendliness, humour and compassion. In 1906 Miss Buchanan was engaged first as a teacher and later as acting headmistress of the famed Singapore Chinese Girls' School; she also taught the orphans at St Mary's Home in Singapore. In 1907 she again underwent major surgery in London and, upon recovery, returned to Thursday Island and was ordained a deaconess in January 1908. In May she went to Moa Island and conducted the Anglican mission, taught school, and tried to inculcate skills necessary for economic self\u2011sufficiency.</p> <p>Florence Buchanan resigned her charge of the mission in 1911 because of deteriorating health, but she stayed on as a teacher. September she performed her last public function when she spoke on 'The mission field as a vocation for women' at the annual congress of the Church of England in Brisbane. She died of tuberculosis in St Helen's Methodist Hospital on 30 December.

Urquhart was educated at the All Saints School in Bloxham, Oxfordshire, and Felsted Military School, Essex. Before Urquhart migrated to Queensland in 1875 to join his godfather, General Fielding, he was a midshipman on a sailing vessel called the \u2018Essex\u2019 which sailed between England and Australia.  When he arrived in Queensland he first worked in the cattle and sugar industries for three years, before becoming a Telegraph Line Repairer with the Electric Telegraph Department in 1878 at Normanton. When Urquhart was faced with an automatic promotion in a clerical capacity he resigned and joined the police force.</p> <p>Urquhart joined the Queensland Native Mounted Police Force on 27<sup>th</sup> April, 1882 as a Cadet Sub-Inspector and was put in charge of the Native Mounted Police. During his seven years with the Native Mounted Police, Urquhart was wounded twice, having been speared in the groin and in the thigh by a tomahawk and had to travel 270 kilometres to receive medical treatment. He eventually transferred to the general police in 1889.  During his time with the Queensland Police he was stationed in several places which included Carl Creek, Dunrobin, Cloncurry, Coreela, Maytown, Thursday Island and Brisbane and found himself involved in some interesting events.</p> <p>In 1890, Urquhart was the first on scene to search for survivors and the bodies from the wreck R.M.S.S. Quetta, a Royal Mail Steamer, en route from Australia to England.  In 1901, during the visit of His Gracious Majesty the King, Urquhart was put in charge of the Royal trains and Government House. When Urquhart was promoted to Second Class Inspector in 1898, Urquhart was in charge of the Criminal Investigation Branch and was eventually at the centre of a controversy in 1899 involving the handling of the investigation into the famous Gatton triple murders.  However, Urquhart survived the enquiry and was eventually promoted to Chief Inspector in 1905.</p> <p>Urquhart was Chief Inspector during Brisbane\u2019s most tumultuous times, when in 1912 Brisbane came to a standstill which was the result of unionists from the Brisbane Tramways Company going on strike. Urquhart and the then Commissioner Cahill were part of the 3000 police in force during the illegal march attended by thousands in Market Street, which finally collapsed and the strike ending due to the police\u2019s baton charge.  He then went on to become our fourth Commissioner in 1917 on January 1<sup>st</sup> and was the first to rise to a commissioned rank from an officer to the top position.</p> <p>Apart from being the Commissioner of the Queensland Police, Urquhart was an accomplished writer of poetry that were published as books and some of his works were \u2018Camp Canzonettes\u2019, \u2018An Ocean Ghost\u2019 and \u2018Legends of the Blacks\u2019. He was also noted for being an early explorer of Queensland having charted Albatross Bay, Emberley and Hay Rivers in Far North Queensland.</p> <p>Urquhart retired from the Police Force in 1921 and was appointed as an Administrator of Northern Territory by the Commonwealth Government and he held this position until 1925.

He was the third surviving son of Charles Alphonse Massy, who had four sons and two daughters, all of whom were born at Gundaroo, New South Wales.</p> <p>Glenville was educated at the Collegiate School, Glebe Point, Sydney, where he studied until he turned seventeen. Owing to an indifferent state of health he did not immediately engage in any particular occupation.</p> <p>A year later, in 1881, he came to Queensland to join his brothers, Charles and Oscar, at Sonoma, a cattle property owned by them near Bowen. He remained on Sonoma for about a year, when, with Charles, he started with a 1000 head of breeders with the view of taking up land on the Lynd, a river which junctions with the Mitchell. On their arrival, however, they learned that the country had already been selected. Their next thought was to obtain pasture for their herd during the advancing wet season.</p> <p>Glenville stayed with the cattle while Charles inspected down the Mitchell and Palmer Rivers and over the Straaten River Valley, becoming familiar with the the country and potential for grazing. When the roads were again traversable, the brothers mustered their stock and continued their journey to the far north, eventually arriving at the Stuart River, where they took up country 1200 kilometres from where they had started. This land was now known as Silver Plains. Its ownership passed to the Queensland Government after the Massys abandoned it when they acquired better country to the west-north-west and moved their stock there. To this property, Rokeby, they devoted many strenuous years. Living 160 kilometres from their nearest neighbour, lacking postal and telegraphic facilities, their only means of procuring stores was by packhorse from Cooktown, a distance of 360 kilometres, at a cost of \u00a335 per ton. They sturdily faced floods and droughts and the many indescribable hardships accompanying such events. There was practically no market for their stock and for several years it was impossible to obtain credit from financial institutions.</p> <p>The Aboriginals constantly killed and harassed the stock and menaced the lives of the settlers. In the efforts of the brothers to halt the attacks by dispersing the Aboriginals, Charles was wounded by a barbed spear which entered his back and became embedded. Glenville helped his older brother to travel over 190 kilometres, but shortly after reaching medical aid Charles died of exhaustion.</p> <p>Oscar joined Glenville at Rokeby. To make it cheaper and quicker to bring in supplies, the Massy brothers pushed a road through to the mouth of the Stuart River. Stores were then transported by sea from Cooktown and then by pack horse at the much reduced rate of \u00a310 per ton. The Queensland Government also used the road for forwarding supplies when building the overland telegraph line to Cape York.</p> <p>When by 1895 it was imperative to find a market for their increasing herd, Glenville moved to Thursday Island and established a butchering business, which he conducted on his own for the following 14 years as a means of absorbing the Rokeby stock. Then the butchering business was floated into a limited company with the title of \"The Torres Straits Fresh Food and Ice Company\", in which Glenville retained an interest for several years.</p> <p>In the meantime the firm acquired Emu Plains, a run adjoining the original Sonoma property. The Massy brothers mutually decided to dissolve the partnership in 1910, Glenville becoming the sole owner of Rokeby and Emu Plains while retaining an interest in Sonoma, which was then administered by Oscar.</p> <p>That year Glenville Massy retired from North Queensland and took up residence at Glenville, on the corner of Milton Road and Hobbs Street, Auchenflower. The house, described as one of the most fashionable of its time, is no longer standing. Glenville spent his days amid comforts which vividly contrast with the frequent privations - such as scarcity of water and lack of food for days at a time - and the many other hardships incidental to a life in the Peninsula.</p> <p>He married Jessie, daughter of James Hall-Scott, a pioneer of the Bowen district in 1897. Jessie's story is told elsewhere.

He was born on 17 August 1860 at Hove, Sussex, son of William Mobsby, watchman, and his wife Sarah, n\u00e9e Humphrys. Henry trained in art, design, chemistry and commercial practice at the School of Arts, Brighton, and in London. In 1883 he accompanied artist Isaac Jenner to Queensland. Mobsby married Jenner's eldest daughter Mary Ellen on 10 September 1884 in Brisbane, and for some years taught decorative art at Brisbane Technical College. </p> <p> </p> <p>Henry Mobsby and his wife Mary Ellen (Nellie) - very early 1900s. </p> <p>By October 1899 Mobsby had produced some thirty, one\u2011minute films during various 'still' photography excursions around Queensland. Among the earliest was the arrival of Governor Lamington for the opening of parliament on 18 May 1899. Most of the films made by Mobsby were shot in the spring of 1899 and illustrated wheat harvesting on the Darling Downs, sugar harvesting at Nambour and aspects of stock management. These were the first Australian industrial documentary films and are among the world's earliest films of the type. Mobsby also filmed the Queensland cabinet boarding the government paddle steamer Lucinda for a ministerial banquet. Their last and most impressive films recorded Queensland troops bound for the South African War, the only known surviving footage of such departure shot in Brisbane between 28 and 31 October 1899. </p> <p>Mobsby became official artist and photographer for the Department of Agriculture in 1904 and remained until his retirement in 1930. He had scant direct involvement in subsequent Queensland government film production, preferring to commission others, such as the Salvation Army\u2019s former cameraman Sid Cook, to undertake the filmmaking. Mobsby's reputation stemmed from his scenic photography and exhibition design. A fellow of both the Royal Geographical Society and the Royal Society of Artists, London, he regularly designed and organised Queensland's exhibits for the annual shows in southern capitals and at the Royal National Exhibition in Brisbane. His photography gained international distinction, and he officially represented Queensland at numerous exhibitions. </p> <p>In December 1905 Mobsby's 11\u2011year\u2011old son Arthur Timewell drowned; each year thereafter, the Mobsby memorial medal was awarded to the Indooroopilly State School student who achieved the highest percentage in the year 8 scholarship public examination. A keen Freemason, Mobsby was a member of the Lodge, Indooroopilly, No.155, United Grand Lodge of Queensland. He died on 9 April 1933 at his home in Station Road, Indooroopilly, and was buried with his son.</p> <p></p> <p>\"The young photographer\" - Arthur Henry Timewell Mobsby circa 1897, with his father's camera and tripod.</p> <p></p> <p>Add to this Story </p>"},{"location":"research/herbert-john-haines/","title":"Herbert John Haines","text":""},{"location":"research/herbert-john-haines/#herbert-john-haines","title":"Herbert John Haines","text":"<p>ca. 1892 - 2 December 1934</p>"},{"location":"research/herbert-john-haines/#herbert-john-haines-10703","title":"Herbert John Haines (10\u201170\u20113)","text":"<p>Enlisted in 1915 in South Australia at age of 23.

When she was widowed again, Mary emigrated to join her daughter, who by this time was in Brisbane. Mary arrived on the 7<sup>th</sup> of January 1877. She had been there only seven years when she died in 1883. As well as Amelia, she had a surviving son, Joseph, and a deceased girl from each of her marriages.</p> <p>Meanwhile, back in the Azores, John and Amelia had two sons, Joseph Hewitt, born on the 24<sup>th</sup> of April 1859 and Henry Hewitt, born on the 15<sup>th</sup> of September 1851. (All their children were given the name 'Hewitt'.)</p> <p>Eight years after their arrival in the Azores, they returned to England, to embark on the Calphumia which sailed for Australia on the 5<sup>th</sup> May 1853. Amelia was pregnant with their third child, Mary Jane Hewitt, who was born on board the ship in Melbourne Harbour on the 19<sup>th</sup> of August 1853. They continued on to Sydney, where John's first teaching post was Campsie, now Trevellyn in the Hunter Valley. He opened the school there in October. He was well regarded; an Inspector recorded that \"his teaching was very superior.\" Their fourth child, John Hewitt, was born at nearby Paterson on the 11<sup>th</sup> of September 1855.</p> <p>John was transferred to Drayton, near Toowoomba, in August 1856. They were at Drayton for three years until Queensland separated from New South Wales in 1859. Ellen Hewitt was born there on the 20<sup>th</sup> of October 1858. A son, Nugent, had been born and died the year before.</p> <p>The high standard of John's teaching was recognised at this school also. Before he left, a public testimonial described him as \"as one of the most able teachers in Queensland.\"</p> <p>Following Separation John was appointed the first headmaster of the newly built Normal School, making him the first Headmaster of the first State School in the new state of Queensland. It opened on the 2<sup>nd</sup> of April 1860 and John remained there till his death on 27<sup>th</sup> of November 1873, aged 45 years of age.</p> <p>Amelia was left with ten children, five more being born at Moorlands Villa, on the site of what is now the Wesley Hospital. They were Letitia Amelia Hewitt, October 1860, Frank Hewitt, August 1862, Anne Hewitt, July 1864, Florence Hewitt, January 1866 and Charles Hewitt, December 1868. </p> <p>Throughout his career John attracted official praise for his teaching, discipline and approachability, and he made an indelible mark on Queensland's educational history. The pupil-teacher training system was inaugurated under his direction.</p> <p>In March 1872 \"after 14 years unremitting mental labour which severely taxed his constitution,\" he became Acting Inspector of the Northern Districts examining all the primary schools north of Brisbane as far as Cardwell.</p> <p>He returned to the Normal School in September of that year and shortly afterwards was presented with a beautiful timepiece, as a testimony to his worth and ability. The inscription on a silver plate attached to the front of the clock reads: \"Presented to John Rendall, Esq. By the teachers and pupils of the Normal School, Brisbane 1873\". It is now in the possession of John's great-grandson.</p> <p>John took leave of absence and after an illness of two weeks, the last five days of which he was in severe pain, he died at his home Moorlands Villa on the 27<sup>th</sup> of November, 1873. The school was closed for the rest of the week as a mark of respect and teachers and pupils alike \"were cast into gloom\".</p> <p> </p> <p>Normal School, Brisbane, ca. 1885 \u2014 State Library of Queensland. Students from the Normal School, Brisbane, ca. 1872 \u2014 State Library of Queensland.</p> <p>A monument to his memory was erected over his grave by pupils and friends connected with the public schools in Brisbane.</p> <p>He was buried in the Presbyterian Cemetery at Paddington, Brisbane. After it was closed it fell into disrepair. In 1911 an Act of Parliament enabled the resumption of such cemeteries and allowed them to be redesignated for public use. Relatives had twelve months to arrange for re-interment. John was re-interred in Toowong Cemetery on the 16<sup>th</sup> of May 1913.</p> <p>A plaque enclosed in three stones from the old Normal School is incorporated in the wall of Anzac Square Building, Edward Street, Brisbane, commemorating the school and John Rendall's association with it.</p> <p>John and Amelia were caring persons, sympathetic to the needs of those worse off than themselves. During the financial crash of 1866 when government funds were cut off, they fed many people who came to them for help with milk from their cow and a bowl of potatoes on their front lawn, although being almost as impoverished themselves.</p> <p>John, with another teacher, Randall MacDonnell, intervened with the Government on behalf of such starving people to get them some relief. He was also a guiding force in the effort to establish a Teachers Union. John was very tolerant in regard to religion.</p> <p>Following John's death, Amelia and her family supported themselves by operating a series of boarding houses, one of which, Cadarga, was in Milton. Following this she had premises in Gregory Terrace, Holyrood, later owned by the Country Women's Association.</p> <p>Amelia lived to the ripe old age of 93, spry to the last, and living to see the birth of the first of her great-grandchildren.</p>"},{"location":"research/john-wood-rendall/#acknowledgement","title":"Acknowledgement","text":"<p>This story was contributed by Ruth Inglis.</p> <p></p> <p>Add to this Story </p>"},{"location":"research/john-wyndon-lyon/","title":"John Wyndon Lyon","text":""},{"location":"research/john-wyndon-lyon/#john-wyndon-lyon","title":"John Wyndon Lyon","text":"<p>1853 - 21 April 1934</p>"},{"location":"research/john-wyndon-lyon/#john-wyndon-lyon-106530","title":"John Wyndon Lyon (10\u201165\u201130)","text":"<p>Lyon was a member of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Battalion, Natal Contingent and saw action at the Battle of Isandhlwana, Rorke's Drift, Gingalore, the relief of Ekouso and was awarded South African Medal.

Born in Ireland in 1847 as Catherine Mary Farrell, she immigrated to Australia with her brother in the 1860s. Kate Farrell is believed to have worked for the Jardine family on Cape York. Certainly she was at Somerset on 27 January 1868 when she married Marine John Smith at the Registrar\u2019s Office. Their marriage certificate shows John was 29, and a piano forte maker like his father; Kate was 21 and described herself as a servant. </p> <p>Kate Mary, a Catholic, and her Anglican husband John, arrived in Brisbane in 1874. Through their respective churches and his Freemasonry, they were able to make extensive social and business connections, despite living in poor circumstances themselves. John often applied his cabinet making and carpentry skills to produce coffins, subsequently becoming an undertaker. They lived in Peel Street, South Brisbane, and later at Manning Street, and bought the undertaking business of William Walsh in 1883. They operated for many years from George Street, just near the old Lands Department, and they competed for business with other undertakers such as Walter Barrett and the Hislops. Two years later John Smith was dealing with his solicitors about leasing land at the corner of Wickham and Gotha Streets, below the steep hill crowned by All Hallows. </p> <p>On 11 January 1886, the Smith family moved from South Brisbane to the Valley where they lived in the upper storey, above the business. Nearby were the very necessary stables, housing the hearses and the black horses that drew them. It was a many-faceted business, and they were on call day and night. But Kate Mary's husband was ill, suffering from consumption, and weakened by an attack on the Marines at Somerset in 1864 in which he had suffered two spear wounds, serious enough for him to have been sent to Sydney for some months. A few months later he died, at Wickham Street, aged 42, and was buried by a Church of England minister at Toowong on 20 May 1886. Kate Mary had run the business for some time already, assisted by her eldest son, John. She had learned how to embalm, a necessary skill to enable the transportation of bodies, but a rare one for a woman to master. This was especially remarkable as women of the time rarely attended funerals let alone work in the industry. She closely monitored all aspects of its operations and insisted on quality service.</p> <p>The company continued to develop as times changed, and was an early mover from horse drawn hearses to motor vehicles completing the process in 1932. Kate Mary was a generous supporter of the church and the Mater hospital. Strong and determined, she has been described as a feisty woman who did not suffer fools gladly. These qualities saw the company flourish, despite the hardships of World War One and the depression. Personal tragedy also continued to strike, by the time of her death in June 1932 aged 85, Kate Mary had buried four of her six children.</p> <p></p> <p>Looking from Centenary Place across Gotha St, Fortitude Valley towards K.M.

In 1852 Callander died aged 31 and Mary married William Howe and bore a daughter, Mary West Howe, in 1857. This second union ended with Howe\u2019s death, and it was as twice\u2011widowed in Sydney, that she met and married the distinguished bachelor, John Douglas, in 1861.

An offer of Mary Douglas and the ladies\u2019 committee was to be the beginning of institutional care for orphaned, destitute and neglected children in Queensland. By the end of 1865 the child\u2011rescue institution at the Fever Hospital had become a busy centre for the increasing number of children unable to be cared for in the southeast of the colony and it was fast becoming a place of placement of any destitute child. The Fever Hospital was not strictly speaking an orphanage: parents who could persuade the orphanage committee of their need stood a good chance of having their application accepted and their child admitted.</p> <p>In 1869 a marked change occurred in management when John and Mary Douglas departed for London where John took up the position of Queensland Agent\u2011General.

Joseph's parents, Thomas Lade and his wife Harriet left the farms that he had managed in Kent and sailed with their three children to Moreton Bay in 1851. Their passage to Sydney on the sailing ship Windsor cost $120 in today's money. The Lades settled at Upper Kedron Brook on land Thomas bought for $124 in the suburb now known as Enoggera. They called their new farm and homestead Surrenden after the property they had lived on in Kent.</p> <p>The hard-working Lades prospered as farmers and fruitgrowers and Thomas Lade won prizes in the first Moreton Bay Horticultural Society's show in 1853. He, with the assistance of his son Joseph, were to distinguish themselves by becoming Queensland's first commercial wine producers and in 1862 Thomas Lade won a medal and certificate of honourable mention at the London International Exhibition. The Lades were considered to be the best authorities on wine culture in the colony.</p> <p>The Lades were devout Baptists. They had been closely involved with their church in Kent and in Brisbane they were foundation members of the Wharf Street Baptist Church.</p> <p>When Joseph married in 1869 he and his wife Mary moved further out on Sanford Road to a farm they called Glen Retreat. Joseph Lade late in life wrote that his family had bought this land in 1851 when Surrenden was purchased but there is evidence to support this date of purchase. Here Joseph planted fruit trees and grapevines while Mary managed a boot and shoe shop on the corner of George and Queen Streets. Mary appears to have been the one with the business head while Joseph was somewhat of a dreamer. As well as managing the city shop Mary bought houses, did them up and sold them.</p> <p>In the year or two before Joseph and Mary Lade's third child was born in 1874, Joseph wanted to increase the number of his citrus trees so he purchased and then planted seeds of oranges and mandarins. One of the latter seedlings had a distinct foliage and went on to produce a high quality fruit that became known as the Beauty of Glen Retreat mandarin, later shortened to Glen Retreat mandarin. However, its commercial success did not come until Lade had sold the Glen Retreat farm to a Mr W. H. Parker around the turn of the century. Parker actively marketed the fruit and by 1927 this mandarin had world-wide distribution.</p> <p>Little is known of Maud's childhood but she did attend the Normal School in Brisbane. She had a lively intelligence and was quick witted and humorous. Six weeks after her nineteenth birthday Maud married William James Affleck on the 13th of July 1893. Some of the manchester in her trousseau she bought at reduced prices as it was flood damaged. This was an aftermath of the great flood that had occurred earlier that year.</p> <p>William and Maud had three children, two daughters Alice Vera and Marjory, and a son Kenneth George, and four grandchildren. The marriage was a happy one.</p> <p>William died in 1932. He had been manager for Queensland of the National Mutual Life Association of Australia, but these were the days before life insurance offices paid generous pensions to the widows of staff officers. Maud endured some financial difficulties during her 33 years of widowhood.</p> <p>She lived in the large house called Ayethorne at Vulture Street, West End from the time the family returned to Brisbane from Townsville in 1902 until her death more than 60 years later. In her widowhood she let the downstairs area as a self-contained flat, and upstairs took in two paying guests to supplement her income.</p> <p>Maud professed to know little of her forebears, though the Lades had lived in Kent for many centuries. Some of the family had lived at Eyethorne, Kent, the name of the West End house apparently being a mis-spelling of the Kentish village. Like her husband, Maud lived her whole life in Queensland always retaining her love of the countryside and interest in rural matters.</p> <p>Maud and William are buried side by side in Toowong Cemetery.</p>"},{"location":"research/maud-voller-affleck/#acknowledgement","title":"Acknowledgement","text":"<p>This story was contributed by Shirley Lahey.</p> <p>The contributor, grand-daughter Shirley Lahey, wishes to acknowledge her debt to John Moran, whose book In the Grip of the Grape gives details of the Lade family's wine growing.</p> <p></p> <p>Add to this Story </p>"},{"location":"research/maurice-charles-o-connell/","title":"Maurice Charles O\u2019Connell","text":""},{"location":"research/maurice-charles-o-connell/#maurice-charles-oconnell","title":"Maurice Charles O\u2019Connell","text":"<p>13 January 1812 \u2014 23 March 1879</p>"},{"location":"research/maurice-charles-o-connell/#colonel-sir-maurice-charles-oconnell-13834","title":"Colonel Sir Maurice Charles O\u2019Connell (13\u201183\u20114)","text":"<p>Administrator:</p> <ul> <li>4 January 1868 to 14 August 1868</li> <li>2 January 1871 to 12 August 1871</li> <li>12 November 1874 to 23 January 1875 </li> <li>14 March 1877 to 10 April 1877</li> </ul> <p>O\u2019Connell was born on 13 January 1812 in Sydney, son of Maurice Charles Philip O'Connell and his wife Mary, daughter of Governor William Bligh.

The revolution in 1917, however brought cause for concern when it was thought more radical refugees were arriving. This caused the Australian Government to declare an embargo on Russian emigrants from 1917\u20111922. When this embargo was lifted in 1922 it gave rise to one of the largest influxes of Russians into Queensland, their population increasing to approximately 3000 by the late 1930s.</p> <p>One of them was Ataman (General) Vladimir Tolstoff, Commander of the 4<sup>th</sup> Ural Cossacks during the revolution. Tolstoff with the assistance of the Russian Relief Force consisting of British Hussars and Australian volunteers were pushing the Red Army back when the enemy successfully infiltrated the British Waterside Workers union and they went on strike stopping the supplies of ammunition and foodstuffs to the White Army. At this point the tide turned and Tolstoff and his men and the relief force were forced to retreat. General Tolstoff lead what remained of his regiment and their families out of Russia and south to Persia by camel and horseback through Kazakhstan and Turkmenia. He and his men were welcomed by the Shah of Persia whose son had trained with Tolstoff. They were fed and clothed and when they had recovered were taken to Basra by ship by the Shah. At Basra the British then sent them by ship to a town near the Chinese border and the next day the red army attacked and they fled over the border into China. The Chinese welcomed them and built villages and even gave them Chinese passports. In 1922 the Australian Government decided to accept them as refugees and they arrived in Brisbane in one shipload. They were productive and some of their inventions in industry are still in use today.</p> <p>As a result of the work of immigrants like those led by General Tolstoff, it is believed more than 10,000 people of Russian descent are currently living in Queensland making valuable contributions to the state.

In 1857 George arrived in Moreton Bay with his parents and sister, older siblings having migrated two years earlier. Their religion was Presbyterian but evidently they were not teetotallers for George was a winemaker and his brother John, who settled at Killarney, south-east Queensland, made wine and had a brandy distillery.</p> <p>The George Affleck family settled at Toolburra, eleven kilometres north-west of Warwick, where they built a homestead they named Riverside on the banks of the Condamine River, a small stream at this point. The old home was moved some years ago so that today's only visible connection is nearby Affleck Bridge. The Afflecks were listed as graziers but as well as running sheep they also grew grain crops and had a herd of dairy cattle, and as a family we recounted among the pioneers of the district. The Affleck clan became the largest landholders in the district, going on to be involved in state politics.</p> <p>In 1867 George Affleck married Alice Moffat Skeldon, who was born in Edinburgh in 1845, arriving in Australia aged nine. Alice went to the Warwick district in 1866 and was probably distantly related to the Afflecks. George and Alice had nine children, the eldest being William James Affleck, born on the 22<sup>nd</sup> of June 1868. When he was six he was enrolled at the local Sandy Creek school, which had opened in 1872. When his primary schooling was completed, William, who was said to an excellent pupil, was sent to Brisbane to attend the Normal School. On completion of his schooling in 1885 William, aged seventeen, obtained a job as a junior clerk with the life insurance company The National Mutual Life Association of Australasia Limited, which had opened its Brisbane branch in 1881. His pay was $90 per annum.</p> <p>On the 13<sup>th</sup> of July 1893 William James Affleck married Maud Voller Lade. They had three children, two daughters and a son.</p> <p>From his humble beginning with The National Mutual in Queensland William James Affleck worked his way to the top after administrative postings in Bowen and Townsville, and then back in Brisbane. He became manager for Queensland in 1919, retaining this position with distinction until his death while on sick leave in 1932 at the age of 64. Other Afflecks had died at an even earlier age suffering from heart disease, the cause of William James Affleck's death.</p> <p>Throughout his life Affleck had retained his links with the land by interesting himself in community affairs and being actively involved with the Royal National Agricultural and Industrial Society, the RNA, when he returned to Brisbane in 1902, from his Townsville posting. He loved horses and in his early working life he rode long distances while on insurance business. In Townsville he had been active in the local agricultural show as well as horse shows.</p> <p>When the family returned to Brisbane in 1902 they rented a house for a short time before settling at 19 Vulture Street, West End, the land running back to Ashington Street. The roomy house stood on one block and the garden and outbuildings occupied three other blocks. Here on the back boundary there were stables where the horses and buggies were kept. The elder daughter Vera learned to ride when quite young, a Shetland pony having been bought for her. Vera rode to school, leaving her horse at the livery stables near where today's City Hall stands. Her father drove his horse and buggy to his city office, one of the clerks then taking the outfit to the same stables.</p> <p>After holding various honorary positions in the RNA in Brisbane, W.J. Affleck became president of this association and was also president of the Stockbreeders' Association of Queensland, the Jersey Cattle Society of Queensland and the Ayrshire Society. Such was Affleck's interest in cattle he was also treasurer of the Hereford Society. He judged cattle and established herd books and half a dozen Herd Book Societies. A building at the Brisbane Exhibition Ground was called Affleck House in his honour.</p> <p>W. J. Affleck was a tall man who held himself erect. He had a commanding presence and a soft heart with a reputation for giving hand-outs to men in need during the Great Depression. He always wore a button-hole and carried a walking stick whether in city circles or in the countryside he loved.</p> <p>As well as Affleck's interest in agricultural matters he was a justice of the peace, a founding Rotarian in Brisbane, and a member and office bearer of the Auchenflower Bowling Club. When Affleck died, it was noted in the newspaper obituaries that he was one of Queensland's most public spirited men.</p>"},{"location":"research/william-james-affleck/#acknowledgement","title":"Acknowledgement","text":"<p>This story was contributed by Shirley Lahey.</p> <p></p> <p>Add to this Story </p>"},{"location":"research/william-james-muldoon/","title":"William James Muldoon","text":""},{"location":"research/william-james-muldoon/#william-james-muldoon","title":"William James Muldoon","text":"<p>Died 23 September 1924</p>"},{"location":"research/william-james-muldoon/#william-james-muldoon-22625","title":"William James Muldoon (2\u201126\u201125)","text":"<p>William James Muldoon, a native of Scotland, was a son of James Muldoon and Mary Louisa (n\u00e9e Noon).

Bill was the eldest boy and Anne, Edward, Wilford, Mary, Victor followed. All the boys joined the Army in the Second World War.</p> <p>As a young school boy, to help family finances, Bill picked turnips from farms into the dark hours of evening after school. His Father was upset to see boy working so hard. He was always a great help to his Mother. He was 17 when, seeking adventure, he joined the Lincolnshire Regiment Regular Army on 11 December 1928. </p> <p>His service overseas included:</p> <ul> <li>Gibraltar - 4 February 1930 to 13 October 1931</li> <li>Shanghai - 14 October 1931 to 2 September 1932</li> <li>Hong Kong - 30 September 1932 to 12 February 1936</li> <li>British Expeditionary Force (BEF) - 13 November 1939 to 7 March 1940</li> </ul> <p>Service details include: </p> <ul> <li>Military Conduct: Very good</li> <li>Medals: 1939-45 Star, War medal 1939-45</li> <li>Rank: Lance Corporal</li> <li>Transferred to Section B reserve 27 February 1936</li> <li>Mobilised: 2 September 1939</li> <li>Discharged: 1 July 1940</li> <li>Cause of discharge: Ceasing to fulfil Army physical requirements due to what he went through at Dunkirk probably related to the injury to his head.</li> </ul> <p> </p> <p>According to his widow, he had a wonderful life in the army. Bill was in the Army Military Brass band, very musical, and played the Clarinet. </p> <p>Bill spoke a bit about the good times in Kowloon. In those days the army band played and were the entertainers at the races, etc. Consequently, for bandsmen, social life in the army left nothing to be desired. He was in the hockey team in India and had a great life in both India and Spain. Bill was a keen sportsman.</p> <p>Bill said when he was in the BEF in France when the Germans by-passed the Maginot Line into France and took Belgium, and the BEF retreated. They had to run for their lives on foot as the German tanks were after them. They jumped on anything available to get to Dunkirk. He waded out to a small boat which took him to a cruiser which took him back to England. He suffered an injury to his head. When he came to Australia after a few years he had a mastoidectemy operation to the area and the specialist said he was not to play clarinet or any other wind instrument again.</p> <p>When he ventured to Australia the Government allowed Poms to migrate for 10 pound single. He preferred to pay his own fare. He had heard what a great country Australia was - the ideal climate and good work opportunities appealed. Still single, Bill liked travel and adventure and he was prepared to start a new life the other side of the world.</p> <p>He made friends with others on board ship and together they worked in the Forestry Dept. on arrival. Later he nursed at the Jubilee hospital Dalby and met his future wife Olive, a sister while there. He enjoyed his time at Dalby. When he left Dalby he was employed by Palings in the Band Instrument Dept. in Queen St, Brisbane. He was very familiar with brass band instruments and was transferred, as Manager, to Grice Nicholsens, in George St. Brisbane. After they closed he went back as a salesman to Queen St. in the Band Inst. Dept. to what became Music Houses of Aust. Ltd. </p> <p>He was always very conscientious, generous to a fault, unassuming and gave of his best. Bill was very loyal to his wife and friends. He had his own special clients who would take to him their various instruments for repair and ask especially for him only to care for their needs. He travelled to various band performances over Queensland and exhibitions for sales. The Brisbane Exhibition always annually. He was offered the position of Manager of the Band instrument dept. in Sydney but refused as he preferred the Queensland people, the climate and the hospitality.</p> <p>He joined the Brisbane Municipal Band in Brisbane and was well liked by the members especially Abby Jackson the Band Master who picked him up every Saturday to play at races, City Hall, and elsewhere. Unfortunately he had to resign or retire after his mastoidectomy operation.</p> <p>Bill now 41 years, married Olive on 10 July 1953 at the Auchenflower Presbyterian Church in Weinholt St. officiated by the Rev. Eric McKay. They lived at Archerfield for 3 years and then bought 91 Munro St. Auchenflower. After Olive's parents passed away they moved to Birdwood Terrace Auchenflower where her parents had lived since their marriage. Bill also joined the Toowong RSL when he came to Auchenflower.</p> <p>Bill retired at the age of 69 years on the 8 April 1980. After marriage he exhibited and bred German Shepherds for a number of years and was very successful in the show ring up and down the East Australian coast. Following this he joined Auchenflower Bowls Club and was fascinated with the game while enjoying the company of other bowlers and was in their pennant teams. At home he kept fowls, had a large vegetable patch and was always very active both in and outside the home.</p> <p>Unfortunately Bill suffered ill health from angina and cardiac heart problems in later years. He never complained or allowed this to prevent him from helping others. He was a resident of Queensland for 58 years.</p> <p>He passed away in the Royal Brisbane hospital 31 January 2004, aged 92 years. His funeral was held at Alex Gow Funeral Parlour the Rev. H.T. Seaton officiating. The Last Post was played and his coffin covered by the British Flag. The RSL President was present at his funeral and a wreath laid.

In 1852 Callander died aged 31 and Mary married William Howe and bore a daughter, Mary West Howe, in 1857. This second union ended with Howe\u2019s death, and it was as twice\u2011widowed in Sydney, that she met and married the distinguished bachelor, John Douglas, in 1861. Douglas was the nephew of the Marquis of Queensbury, a former pupil of Rugby School, and graduate of Durham University.

She was the leader of the ladies\u2019 committee, a reflection of the confidence and respect in which she was held by the Hospital committee. An offer of Mary Douglas and the ladies\u2019 committee was to be the beginning of institutional care for orphaned, destitute and neglected children in Queensland. By the end of 1865 the child\u2011rescue institution at the Fever Hospital had become a busy centre for the increasing number of children unable to be cared for in the southeast of the colony and it was fast becoming a place of placement of any destitute child. The Fever Hospital was not strictly speaking an orphanage: parents who could persuade the orphanage committee of their need stood a good chance of having their application accepted and their child admitted.</p> <p>In 1869 a marked change occurred in management when John and Mary Douglas departed for London where John took up the position of Queensland Agent\u2011General. Around this time Governor Blackall made a public presentation of a silver salver to Mary Douglas and the Ladies\u2019 Committee, in the presence of a veritable \u2018Who\u2019s Who\u2019 of Brisbane society gathered at the Diamantina Orphanage.

Despite her extremely delicate constitution and near\u2011blindness, she devoted herself as a young woman to both practical charity and prayer. After a physical breakdown in 1887, she accompanied her two brothers to Bundaberg, Queensland, where they purchased Oakwood, a substantial cane\u2011farm. Seriously injured in a riding accident in 1888, she was left permanently crippled. After teaching her Melanesian servants English and Bible stories, she later assumed responsibility for the non\u2011denominational South Seas Evangelical Mission (also known as the Queensland Kanaka Mission).

In 1906 Miss Buchanan was engaged first as a teacher and later as acting headmistress of the famed Singapore Chinese Girls' School; she also taught the orphans at St Mary's Home in Singapore. In 1907 she again underwent major surgery in London and, upon recovery, returned to Thursday Island and was ordained a deaconess in January 1908.

Born in Ireland in 1847 as Catherine Mary Farrell, she immigrated to Australia with her brother in the 1860s. Kate Farrell is believed to have worked for the Jardine family on Cape York. Certainly she was at Somerset on 27 January 1868 when she married Marine John Smith at the Registrar\u2019s Office. Their marriage certificate shows John was 29, and a piano forte maker like his father; Kate was 21 and described herself as a servant. </p> <p>Kate Mary, a Catholic, and her Anglican husband John, arrived in Brisbane in 1874. Through their respective churches and his Freemasonry, they were able to make extensive social and business connections, despite living in poor circumstances themselves. John often applied his cabinet making and carpentry skills to produce coffins, subsequently becoming an undertaker. They lived in Peel Street, South Brisbane, and later at Manning Street, and bought the undertaking business of William Walsh in 1883. They operated for many years from George Street, just near the old Lands Department, and they competed for business with other undertakers such as Walter Barrett and the Hislops. Two years later John Smith was dealing with his solicitors about leasing land at the corner of Wickham and Gotha Streets, below the steep hill crowned by All Hallows. </p> <p>On 11 January 1886, the Smith family moved from South Brisbane to the Valley where they lived in the upper storey, above the business. Nearby were the very necessary stables, housing the hearses and the black horses that drew them. It was a many-faceted business, and they were on call day and night. But Kate Mary's husband was ill, suffering from consumption, and weakened by an attack on the Marines at Somerset in 1864 in which he had suffered two spear wounds, serious enough for him to have been sent to Sydney for some months. A few months later he died, at Wickham Street, aged 42, and was buried by a Church of England minister at Toowong on 20 May 1886. Kate Mary had run the business for some time already, assisted by her eldest son, John. She had learned how to embalm, a necessary skill to enable the transportation of bodies, but a rare one for a woman to master. This was especially remarkable as women of the time rarely attended funerals let alone work in the industry. She closely monitored all aspects of its operations and insisted on quality service.</p> <p>The company continued to develop as times changed, and was an early mover from horse drawn hearses to motor vehicles completing the process in 1932. Kate Mary was a generous supporter of the church and the Mater hospital. Strong and determined, she has been described as a feisty woman who did not suffer fools gladly. These qualities saw the company flourish, despite the hardships of World War One and the depression.

In an effort to create employment and provide support for families during the depression, the Hornibrook Highway was constructed during the 1930s and included what was Australia's longest bridge at the time of its construction.

The revolution in 1917, however brought cause for concern when it was thought more radical refugees were arriving. This caused the Australian Government to declare an embargo on Russian emigrants from 1917\u20111922.

At this point the tide turned and Tolstoff and his men and the relief force were forced to retreat. General Tolstoff lead what remained of his regiment and their families out of Russia and south to Persia by camel and horseback through Kazakhstan and Turkmenia. He and his men were welcomed by the Shah of Persia whose son had trained with Tolstoff. They were fed and clothed and when they had recovered were taken to Basra by ship by the Shah. At Basra the British then sent them by ship to a town near the Chinese border and the next day the red army attacked and they fled over the border into China. The Chinese welcomed them and built villages and even gave them Chinese passports. In 1922 the Australian Government decided to accept them as refugees and they arrived in Brisbane in one shipload.
