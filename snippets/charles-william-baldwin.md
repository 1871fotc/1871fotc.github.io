Born in England Charles was a 42-year-old painter when he enlisted in the 26^th^ Battalion, a widower at the time with a daughter and son.  Charles enlisted in 1915 and in his service record it states:

> - 13/4/1916 Bronchitis
> - 31/5/1916 Sick to hospital with bronchitis 
> - 1/6/1916 To hospital with synovitis in the knee
> - 1/7/1916 admitted to hospital again with bronchitis and knee synovitis
> - 1/5/1917 Went back to Australia with rheumatoid arthritis and discharged in Brisbane. 

In April 1922 he was mentioned in the paper in an article titled “UNLICENSED HAWKER” where at the age of 53 he pleaded guilty to a charge that in Moorooka he carried on the business of a hawker and pedlar without a licence and was fined 3 pound in default seven days in prison.

Charles somehow ended up in the Goodna mental hospital where he died in 1926 of ‘paralytic dementia’.
