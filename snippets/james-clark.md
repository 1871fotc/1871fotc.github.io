## James Clark <small>(14‑22‑12)</small>

[James Clark](https://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/clark-james-5664) "The Pearl King" (1857-1933) was born on the Hunter River in NSW. When he was three, he came to Brisbane with his mother and siblings, following the death of his father Adam. After a rudimentary education, he began work as a plasterers' boy at James Campbell & Co. 

Some years later after gaining business experience, he went north to Cape York and entered into a business partnership with Frank Jardine in 1881 to try pearling. The business prospered and, by the time the partnership ended, they had built up a fleet of pearling vessels which was divided between them. James became a leader in the pearling industry and later a successful pastoralist.
