Mary McIntosh was born ca. 16 August 1826 at Kilkishen, near Ennis, County Clare, Ireland. She migrated to Sydney as a single woman in the *Champion* in February 1842. On 9 April 1849 in Brisbane she married Patrick Mayne.

Mary and Patrick had six children, of whom three sons and two daughters reached adulthood. Patrick purchased a butchery in Queen Street Brisbane in 1849, built a substantial enterprise owning hotels, shops and houses, and speculated in land. He was on the first municipal council in Brisbane.

A codicil to Patrick’s will appointed Mary as executrix of the Mayne estate. After his death on 17 August 1865, Mary largely controlled the management of the estate. In March 1876 she bought *Moorlands Villa* to become the family home and almost six hectares of land on which it stood at Auchenflower. Mary died of coronary heart disease at the age of 63 on 4 September 1889.

Mary Emelia Mayne, born 31 December 1858, was the second youngest daughter of Mary and Patrick. [She was a philanthropist](https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/22759764) along with her brother, James.
