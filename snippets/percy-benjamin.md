## Percy Benjamin <small>(3‑12‑7/8)</small>

Percy Benjamin was a son of Sir Benjamin Benjamin and Lady Fanny Benjamin. Sir Benjamin owned a Melbourne Savings bank. About the turn of the century there was an unexplained 'rush on the banks', when people drew out their money in a great panic for no reason. Sir Benjamin put all his own funds into his bank in an effort to reassure the people, but it was to no avail. He lost everything and was bankrupted. Percy's monument was provided by his Brisbane employers, S. Hoffnung & Co.
