## Henry Bloomfield Gough <small>(2‑44‑21)</small>

Gough, who until the beginning of 1895 occupied the position of Police Magistrate at Warwick, died in the St. Clair private hospital, Brisbane, on 29 January 1896. Gough was an officer of the Native Police in the early days, and saw many years of active frontier life. Subsequently he was appointed Police Magistrate at Isisford, in the Barcoo country, and in that position did good service for the colony. About the beginning of 1892 he was transferred to Ingham where he spent a couple of years. The climate did not agree with him, and he was strong in the opinion that it was while he resided at Ingham he contracted the complaint which claimed his life. From Ingham he was promoted to Warwick. His health, already impaired, gradually declined, and in February 1895 he obtained leave of absence for six months and paid a visit to the hot springs in New Zealand. He derived no benefit from the change, however, and returning to Queensland, entered the private hospital in Brisbane where he died. Gough was 51 years of age.
