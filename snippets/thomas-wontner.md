## Thomas Wontner <small>(13‑26‑21)</small>

Another notable compositor of the early days was Thomas Wontner. Thomas did his apprenticeship in a London office where high class reviews were printed. He arrived in Brisbane in the early 1860's and was first employed on the *Guardian* and *Weekly Herald* newspapers, being foreman in charge of the latter. When those journals closed down he went to work at the *Courier* as a compositor. Thomas was later appointed head reader, a position he held until his death on 11 August 1894 at the age of 68 years.
