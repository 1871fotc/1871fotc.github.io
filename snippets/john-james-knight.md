## John James Knight <small>(8‑33‑32)</small>

John was born on 7 June 1863 at Shelton, Staffordshire, England. He was taken to New Zealand as a young boy. He left school at age 11 to learn printing. He returned to England where, with two others, he started the Staffordshire Knot, a paper sympathetic to the interests of trades unionism. John migrated to Queensland in 1884 and found work with the Brisbane Newspaper Co Ltd as a printer. He soon became a reporter on the  *Brisbane Courier* and became Chief Parliamentary Reporter in the 1890's. John played a considerable part in the policy of the Labour Party in Queensland. 

During the industrial turmoil of the 1890s he preferred to investigate local history. His works included *In the Early Days* (1895), *Australian Pioneers and Reminiscences* (1896) completed after the death of Nehemiah Bartley from Bartley's notes and diaries, and *Brisbane: a Historical Sketch of the Capital of Queensland* (1897). In 1906 John became editor of the *Courier* and in 1916 became managing director of the Brisbane Newspaper Co Ltd and subsequently combined that office with the position of chairman of directors. He died on 24 November 1927.
