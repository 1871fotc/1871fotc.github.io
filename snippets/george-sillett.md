## George Sillett <small>(5‑65‑9)</small>

George Sillett was born in Durham in the north of England in 1866. He arrived in Brisbane in December 1885. A little under a year later he married Durham lass, Margaret Ann Gill at All Saint’s Church of England, Ann Street. At the time, George Sillett was managing Petrie’s Undertaking Establishment at 550 Queen Street. 

After the short lived partnership with Alma Adlington, George Sillett went into business with Walter Scott Barrett, the son of undertaker Walter Barrett. From 1893, the firm Sillett and Barrett traded from Petrie Bight with a branch office at Roma Street. 

Alexander Gow purchased an interest in the firm on the death of George Sillett, aged 42, from influenza exacerbated by heavy drinking on 7 September 1908. He had been a prominent member of the Grand United Order of Oddfellows which is symbolised on his headstone by the two male hands clasped.
