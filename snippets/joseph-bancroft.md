[Dr Joseph Bancroft](https://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/bancroft-joseph-2927) (1836-1894) was a general practitioner, surgeon, medical researcher, inventor, parasitologist and canned meat manufacturer. He was the only child of Joseph Bancroft, farmer, of Stretford, Manchester, England, and his wife Ann, née Lane. Seeking a warmer climate for health reasons, he arrived in Brisbane in 1864 with his wife and children. In addition to carrying out his duties as a medical practitioner, he was keenly interested in the problems affecting stock and agriculture and experimented with plant varieties to establish those suitable for growing in Queensland's climate. 

After his death, his son [Dr Thomas Lane Bancroft](https://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/bancroft-thomas-lane-5120) (1860-1933), a medical scientist and administrator, continued his father's work in agriculture and parasitology.
