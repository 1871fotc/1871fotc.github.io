## James George Drake <small>(18‑136‑3)</small>

James was born on 26 April 1850 in London. He arrived in Brisbane on 14 January 1874. He became a journalist working on regional newspapers as well as the Brisbane Telegraph and the *Brisbane Courier* and, briefly, the *Melbourne Argus*. A competent shorthand writer, later president of the Queensland Shorthand Writers' Association, James was on the parliamentary reporting staff from 1876-1882. He studied law in his spare time and was called to the bar in 1882. Long a radical, his objection to Asian immigration into Queensland led him into association with William Lane. He became a shareholder, writer and joint editor of Lane's weekly *Boomerang* in 1887. 

In 1888 James entered politics and at the end of 1899, he was appointed government leader in the Queensland Legislative Council and
Postmaster-General and Secretary for Public Instruction. He was an energetic supporter of Federation, writing frequently in newspapers, publishing the pamphlet *Federation, Imperial or Democratic* and running his own fortnightly paper *Progress* which espoused the cause. 

Upon Federation, he won election to the first Senate, and was chosen to be Postmaster-General in Edmund Barton's first ministry, following the death of Sir James Dickson. In early 1906 Drake ran a newspaper, *Commonwealth* in Brisbane to counteract State hostility to the Commonwealth. He died in Brisbane Hospital on 1 August 1941.
