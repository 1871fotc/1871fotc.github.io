## Edward Hobbs <small>(13‑55‑5)</small>

Edward Hobbs was killed by falling tree at Redcliffe on 4 January 1875 aged 13 years and nine months. He was out shooting with a cousin when they sat down to watch some men felling a tree. The tree didn’t fall in the direction which Edward anticipated and he was crushed. Edward’s father was the well‑known doctor, William Hobbs, who, being in Brisbane at the time of the accident, was unable to assist his son. Edward was interred at the old Milton cemetery and then when it closed, relocated to Toowong.

> Green be the turf above thee <br>
> Son of my happier days <br>
> None knew thee but to love thee  <br>
> None knew thee but to praise <br>
> While memory bids me to weep tho’ <br> 
> Nor thoughts nor word are free <br>
> The grief is fixed too deeply  <br>
> That mourn a lad like thee. <br>
