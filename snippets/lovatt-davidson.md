Although discharged as unfit, and his medical file said he suffered from rheumatism during the war, he was denied a war pension after he was unable to continue his job as a cleaner due to ill health. He died possessing only a watch, chain and spectacles. In the Qld Museum memoirs they wrote that Lovatt described his health as,

> “I hereby declare that my condition if anything is worse than at the time of my discharge. I suffer with palpitations, giddiness and shortness of breath. For some time past I have not been sleeping well and have gone off my food. My nerves are giving me considerable trouble and I am shaky, the least excitement knocking me over.” 

After several months in the inebriation institution in Dunwich in 1925 he wrote,

> “At night I am unable to sleep properly through pains in my body and my heart. I have to sit up very often to get my breath again. I also get very bad dreams of which I cannot explain the sensations. These dreams leave me very weak.”

Lovatt passed away on 14/3/1938 with his death certificate recording the cause as a heart attack.
