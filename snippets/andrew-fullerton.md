## Andrew Fullerton <small>(2A‑11‑19)</small>

After free settlement began in 1842, Ipswich developed as an important regional centre because of its location at the head of navigation of the Brisbane and Bremer Rivers and at the junction of routes to the Brisbane Valley and the Darling Downs.

Irish-born 'Andy' Fullerton was appointed 'wharfinger' or wharf manager for the Australasian Navigation Company at Ipswich when the river steamers including *Brisbane*, *Ipswich* and *Emu* played a vital role in the river trade between Brisbane and Ipswich in 1875. Andrew became a driver of steam trains. He died on 10 April 1899 aged 68 years.
