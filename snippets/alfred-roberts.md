## Alfred Roberts <small>(13‑1‑2)</small>

Alfred was born in 1837 in Putney, London and arrived in Queensland in 1860. In 1872 he began a [horse‑drawn omnibus line](https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/3523264?searchTerm=Roberts) which operated between Eagle Street in the city and the present site of the Taringa Shopping Centre, where the Roberts’ home was. The fare to the city was one shilling or one shilling and sixpence return. Alfred would announce his arrival with a bugle call. The business was lost when [the stables burned down](https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/174074822) in 1893. The Roberts family took up farming in Moggill.
