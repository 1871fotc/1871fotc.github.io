## Thomas Illidge <small>(13‑24‑1)</small>

London-born Thomas Illidge (1823-1896) was the son of Thomas Illidge and Harriett (née Muckleton). For some years, he was the proprietor of a boot and shoe store in Sydney before bringing his wife, Ann and family to Brisbane where [he recommenced his business in Queen Street in 1859](https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/183094408). Ann died in 1882 and was the first burial in this plot. Thomas married again but was buried here with his first wife. Other family members were later interred in the same plot.
