## Midshipman: John Forrest Haymen <small>[(12‑49‑3)](https://brisbane.discovereverafter.com/profile/31897629 "Go to Memorial Information" )</small>

Born 29 June 1902 to Marmaduke Granville Haymen and Florence Maud Lucretia Goertz in Indooroopilly, Brisbane. A very unusual service record. Sadly the Australian Naval records are very brief and very hard to read unlike the Australian Imperial Force records.
