## Before you start the walk

Before you start the walk, wear comfortable shoes, use sun protection, carry water, and read the Brisbane City Council Cemeteries - Conditions of Entry.

???+ warning "Conditions of Entry" 

    Brisbane City Council seeks your assistance to maintain a safe and peaceful environment for all visitors to enjoy visiting our City Cemeteries.
    
    You can play your part by having consideration for other visitors in our grounds by: 
    
    - entering only between 6:00am and 6:00pm.
    - not walking on, or across monuments or headstones and by not walking on or across lawn graves that may have subsided as these may be unstable.
    - not leaning on, against or standing under, or on any monument structure. 
    - whilst every care is taken to remove trip hazards, some surfaces may be sloping or uneven. Care should be taken when working on grassed areas, particularly when wet and visitors should remain on pathways where possible.
    - being aware of heavy machinery, mowers and other equipment being used.
    - not placing glass bottles, vases or ceramic containers and statues on graves which may become damaged and dangerous.
    - individual grave maintenance is the responsibility of the family of the deceased and must not be undertaken without a permit from Council.
    
    Council accepts no responsibility for loss or damage to any vehicle, structure, monument, personal property, or thing, or any injury to any person no matter how any such injury, loss or damage may arise or be caused.
