On 20 June 1888, Alfred remarried, to Jessie Catherine Shearer, in the Congregational Church in Wharf Street. In the 1890s, the Raymond family lived in Kangaroo Point. It was while living there that Alfred became interested in politics and in 1894 he was elected as Alderman for the ward of Kangaroo Point. Although South Brisbane was then a separate town to Brisbane, Kangaroo Point was still a ward of Brisbane. Alfred represented Kangaroo Point from 1894 to 1899 when resigned from politics. However, he returned as Alderman for Kangaroo Point again from 1902 to 1903 and then from 1911 to 1924.
