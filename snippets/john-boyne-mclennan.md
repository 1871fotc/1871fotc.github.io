## John Boyne McLennan <small>(13‑58‑3)</small>

<!-- 1827 - 21 November 1908 -->

John Boyne Mclennan died on the 21^st^ of November 1908 at the ripe old age of 81 years at his residence in Kent Street, Teneriffe. He was resident in Queensland for over fifty years, and during the whole of that time he had been closely connected with racing.

His first occupation in Queensland, at that time a part of New South Wales, was that of studmaster at *Canning Downs*, near Warwick, but in 1863 he came to Brisbane, and for some years conducted the Sovereign Horse Bazaar in Elizabeth Street. John Mclennan was an amateur rider of some note, but he is remembered as being mainly instrumental with John Little and Mr D.T. Seymour in forming the Queensland Turf Club. He also took an active part in the formation of Tattersall's Club and was for a number of years President. After acting as a committee member on the Q.T.C. for a number of years, John Mclennan occupied the position of judge at the club's meetings, but during his last ten years he lived in retirement.

John Mclennan was born at Aberdeen, Scotland in 1827. At the age of 19, he migrated to Victoria, where he stayed for only a short time before moving north. He married Miss Georgina Wilson of Warwick in 1863 and they had six children. Besides his racing interests, John Mclennan was an office bearer at the Ann Street Presbyterian Church, where he had been a member of the congregation for many years.

The funeral took place at Toowong Cemetery, and the respect in which John was held was shown by the large attendance at the graveside and the names of the senders of the many beautiful wreathes, which were recorded in a report of the funeral printed in the Daily Telegraph.
