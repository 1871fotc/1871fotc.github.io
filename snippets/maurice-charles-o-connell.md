O’Connell was born on 13 January 1812 in Sydney, son of Maurice Charles Philip O'Connell and his wife Mary, daughter of Governor William Bligh. He left for Ceylon with his parents in 1814 and in 1819 was sent to Europe for schooling. In 1828 he joined the 73^rd^ Regiment at Gibraltar but in 1835 raised and led a regiment of Irish volunteers in the Spanish Carlist wars, rising to general of brigade in the British Auxiliary Legion. Before embarking for Spain he married Eliza Emily le Geyt on Jersey. On disbandment, O'Connell returned to England and in June 1838 purchased a captaincy in the 28^th^ Regiment. That year his father was appointed to command the troops in New South Wales. After the regiment sailed to India in 1842 he stayed in New South Wales and sold his commission in 1844. 

He represented Port Phillip from August 1845 to June 1848 and then became Commissioner of Crown Lands for the Burnett District. Early in 1854 O'Connell became government Resident at the new Port Curtis settlement where he acquired several squatting properties. In 1859 O'Connell was given command of the volunteers. He was also nominated to the Legislative Council and acted as Minister without portfolio in the first Herbert ministry. When Sir Charles Nicholson resigned in August 1860 O'Connell became President of the Council. He held the post until 1879 and acted ex officio as deputy to the governor four times. O'Connell was knighted in 1868. He died of cancer at Parliament House on 23 March 1879.
