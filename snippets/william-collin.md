## William Collin <small>(12‑56‑22)</small>

William, a master mariner, was born on 30 August 1834 at Great Wakering, Essex, the ninth of thirteen children of John Collin, a Suffolk farmer and his wife Sarah, née Viner. After only a basic education, fourteen‑year‑old William was working in the coastal coal trade and later on barges in the Thames. He left for Australia via Panama in 1854. Surviving a shipwreck 800 km off the Queensland coast, he eventually arrived in Sydney, via Calcutta! 

He married Eliza Baker of Newton on Christmas Day 1857 at Stephen’s, Camperdown. He worked on the Sydney waterfront until he could afford to purchase and refit a 25‑ton vessel. He sailed this ship to Brisbane, where he settled with his family (which would eventually comprise thirteen children), and commenced a freight service to near‑by coastal ports. William's other interest was the salvaging and breaking of ships. He was also engaged by the Queensland Government to lay submarine cables. 

William’s son and namesake was said to be the first Queensland‑born sailor to receive his master’s certificate.
