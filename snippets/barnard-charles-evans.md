Matthew and Elizabeth Muir sold their house in 1917 and it became home to a succession of prominent men. Barnard Charles Evans bought the house from the Muirs.  Colonel C P Evans CMG, the Commissioner of Railways, lived in the house which he called “Ac-land” until about 1920. Colonel Charles Evans was Railways Commissioner from 1911 until 1918. Evans, as Commissioner, oversaw the introduction of the policy of decentralisation of administration for Queensland Railways from 1914, as well as being the Commissioner who led Queensland Railways into one of its more intense periods of construction and technical development in the period 1911-1920. In his term as Commissioner, Evans’ policies saw new rolling stock being designed and constructed for use on the railways, including high passenger capacity carriages on suburban trains, which were named after him.  Larger locomotives were also introduced to haul increased loads on thenetwork. Evans was also a supporter of the concept of a standard gauge to be used throughout Australia, and was an advocate of an efficient and modern railway network not only in Queensland, but throughout Australia.

Evans joined the Queensland Railways service in May 1867, when the only line was from Ipswich to Toowoomba a distance of 78 miles (126 km). In 1884 he was appointed inspector of the southern and western divisions. In 1885 he was appointed timetable clerk by J. T. Thallon,[2] then in 1890 was promoted to traffic superintendent and in 1891 district traffic manager for Townsville and in 1894 the same position in Maryborough. During this time he earned Thallon's thanks for his performance during a flood disaster, and a bonus for his expeditious organisation of a line duplication.[2] He became traffic manager, Townsville, in 1896; in 1901 the Commissioner's inspector for the northern division and in early May 1908 succeeded Robert Dunbar as general traffic manager, Brisbane.[3] On 1 June 1911 he succeeded Thallon and (briefly) King as Commissioner,[4] a position he held until his retirement in July 1918.[5]

During his time as commissioner, many large and important works were completed: sheds for rolling stock at Mayne, rearrangement of the facilities at Roma Street, Ipswich, South Brisbane, Toowoomba, Warwick, and Townsville, a new locomotive depot at Rockhampton, and a great deal of line duplication throughout the State.[5]

In 1914 he was awarded the distinction of CMG.[6]

Evans married Mary Ann Thompson on 22 March 1867. [7] She died on 6 March 1919 at the family home "Acland," Adelaide Street, Clayfield.

COLONEL EVANS'S CAREER

If America Ins its picturesque stories of the "Log Cabin to White House" kind, Australia has equally picturesque stories of men who have gone from the coal pit to the Prime Minister's chair. from the footplates to the Commissioner's office and others of a more or less romantic tinge. Amongst those might well be classed the story of Colonel Charles Evans, CMG , who progressed in the Queensland railway service from guard to Commissioner. It has been said of Colonel Chas. Evans that he was born a railway-man. His father was in the ser vice of the Great Western Railway in England for over 40 years, and the son, who afterwards achieved the highest dis-tinction in the Queensland railway ser-vice, was apprenticed to the same com-pany. He was but a lad, however, when he carme to Queensland in the y ear 1867 to join the infant railway service. He was one of the earliest guards in Queensland, and for many years travel

led the line between Ipswich and Too

woomba. When the late Mr. Thallon returned to Queensland from New South Wales, where he had accepted a brief appointment, he was appointed to the control of the traffic, and he selected Mr Evans as clerk in charge of trains. Early in the eighties Mr Evans was appointed traffic superintendent for the metropolitan district, and during the absence of his chief from the State he was called upon to meet a rather sensational emergency, caused by heavy floods. He did it, however, so capably that he earned the warm thanks of Mr Thallon, and some time later he was awarded a substantial bonus for his efficiency in carrying on the service between Brisbane and Ipswich whilst the line was being relaid and duplicated. In the year 1896 Mr. Evans was appointed to the position of traffic manager at Townsville, and subsequently, in addition to that office, he was appointed inspecting officer for the whole of the Northern railways. In 1909, on the retirement of Mr Dunbar, he was ap pointed General Traffic Manager for Queensland, and two years later he was appointed Commissioner for Railways after the retirement of Mr King, who filled the position for a year subsequent to the death of Mr. Thallon.

As an administrator. Colonel Evans was direct and blunt, so much so that what was really a mannerism of honesty was frequently attributed to rude-ness. He was as plain as a pikestaff, and when he did not approve of the attitude of either subordinate or Minister he said so in language that could easily be understood. He did not like Ministerial interference with his duties, and he said so: and on more than one occasion he informed politicians that he would look after his business and they could attend to theirs. When the financial administration of the railways was practically taken out of his hands by Caucus interference, he had to submit, but he had the satisfaction of telling more than one Cabinet Minister that the Government was turninpr a magnificent asset into a heavy liability on' the State. In the year 1913 Colonel Evans took a trip - to America, England, and South Africa, and in the following year, just before the outbreak of war, he was awarded the honour of Companionship of the Order of St. Michael and St. George. About the same time he was honoured with the rank of'"Colonel"-a rank be-stowed on all the Chief Commissioners in Australia because of their co-operation in regard to defence. On October 31, 1918. Colonel Evans, retired from tbe office of Commissioner, and had lived quietly in Brisbane since, enjoying a respite from a very active life.

The deceased, whose wife predeceased him about two years ago, is survived bv four sons-Messrs. Charles and William 'who reside in North Queens-land, George, and James (of Brisbane)and three daughters (Mesdames Hogan and Curtis, and Miss Evans),

Colonel Charles Evans CMG worked for one of the great industrial enterprises of the 19th and early 20th centuries in Queensland, namely the railways. As Commissioner for Queensland Railways Evans was very much the public face of the railways prominent in newspapers and publications of the day. He was no retiring, faceless holder of a public office. He sought the promotion of the Queensland Railways, through the media of the day, and also highlighted the tourism opportunities of the State. He was a self-promoter, and also asked to be seen by his employees as an example of what could be achieved by them. Evans valued independence in his role as Commissioner for Railways preferring politicians should attend to their official business and by doing so he could attend to his business.

Queensland Railways held the government monopoly on land transport. An advocate of personally being involved in the running of the railways, Evans saw the railway in common with the Edwardian notion of a military service, which also entailed ideas of loyalty, discipline, and responsibility. As the largest of the State’s enterprises, he was responsible for the safe carriage of millions of pounds worth of goods, and millions of passengers, and responsible for the 12 000 employees within his remit.

The career of Charles Evans was defined by storms, floods, and other tempests, including strikes and political battles. There are a number of firsts that placed him in a unique position, the first Commissioner for Railways in Queensland to make his way up through the ranks. The award of a CMG was the first given to a railway commissioner in Australia. He was an advocate of superannuation for railway workers, and saw Trade Unions as a legitimate representative of workers, but maintained that as Commissioner for Railways the railway was ultimately his responsibility. His leadership principles were demonstrated on a number of occasions, such as the recovery efforts at Clermont after the floods there in 1916, in Rockhampton in 1918, and in the floods of Brisbane in 1890.
