## Walter Hammond <small>[(10‑51‑12)](https://brisbane.discovereverafter.com/profile/31723157 "Go to Memorial Information" )</small>

When Walter enlisted at age 21 like a lot of soldiers listed a sibling as next of kin. Walter listed his sister Violet Hammond as his Next of Kin as both parents were deceased.

Walter’s war record shows he disembarked in April 1917 and by October 1917 he had lost an arm. He had to undergo the amputation when he was shot in the arm, foot and shoulder. He was right-handed so had to learn to write with his left. It’s interesting to note that WW1 soldiers were not entitled to a full pension if they only had one amputation – they had to have had two amputations. He also suffered from chronic nephritis like a lot of soldiers – often due to little studied condition called ‘trench nephritis’. 

His service record like many soldiers contained reference to some transgressions and the resulting penalties (forfeit of pay). Walter’s caught my eye as it was slightly unusual.  During a concert at their dry canteen (no alcohol) Walter twice used insubordinate language in the presence of his officer. He had to forfeit three days’ pay for that.

On his file are many letters from his sister Violet and responses from the Army – she was trying to find out his whereabouts, condition and requested if he could come home. Some extracts are as follows – Letter dated July 1918:

>“To Senator Pearce
>
>Dear sir, 
>
>your letter is to hand of July 15th re my brother Walter Hammond for which I thank you very sincerely. Can you tell me whether he is going duty or in the hospital, if so, would you kindly send me his address, as I would like to write direct to the hospital and surely someone would write a line to me for him. I keep writing every mail and still have not received a line since he was wounded in October 1917. I would very much rather know the worst than keep on trying to bear the suspense as it is killing me. I am very sorry to trouble you again but if I could only get the address where he is, I could write direct. 
>
>Thanking you in anticipation yours very gratefully 
>
>Violet Hammond.“

Violet even got a special inquiry officer appointed to her case to get her brother home or at least hear from him. This special officer wrote -

Another letter from Violet said:

>“Please pardon me for troubling you with a letter, but I am nearly distracted through worrying about my brother Walter Hammond who I was informed through the military was wounded 23rd October 1917 with gunshot wound in the right shoulder and was at the Eastbourne military hospital. It is now nearly 8 months and I have not heard one word from him and can get no information either at the Victoria Barracks Sydney nor the Red Cross as they said he enlisted in Queensland and I can only hear from them. As he is all I have belonging to me I would feel very grateful to you if you would let me know why he is not returned back to Australia as he cannot do any further service with his right arm off. Trusting you will do all in your power. 
>
>Anxiously yours Violet Hammond.“

Walter finally disembarked back in Australia in January 1919, presumably much to his sister’s delight, over a year after his gun shot wound which resulted in his amputation. But unfortunately, Walter died a few years later in 1922 at the age of 26, from tuberculosis. He is getting an official war grave.
