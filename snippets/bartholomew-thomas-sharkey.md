==I was successful in finding a great nephew on Ancestry called Simon Gillespie who lives in America and who was very excited that he might finally be getting his grave marked. Bartholomew or Bart as Simon calls him, was quite ‘anxious to serve’ in the AIF. He received medals in the Boer War which he sent back to his nephews in Ireland. But he was quite unwell after the first world war and never fully recovered from his injury. He did not work after leaving the army – he travelled around Australia looking for work but was not successful. He had emphysema and cirrhosis of the liver and died from heart problems on 8th January 1941. An email from Simon is as follows but first a photo==
