## William Henry Roberts <small>(13‑10‑4)</small>

William Roberts was the son of Charles Roberts, a store keeper with the Commissariat Department, and Esther Dale, the first teacher of girls in the Moreton Bay settlement. On 11^th^ of June 1829 he was christened by the Reverend John Vincent, who resided at the Moreton Bay Settlement from late March to December 1829. This baptism was the third of only six Vincent conducted during his short tenure. The entry indicated that William Henry Roberts had been born on the 15^th^ of September 1828. The inscription on the top of the chest tomb memorial originally intimated that he had died of illness on 15^th^ of November 1831 aged just three years and two months. The tomb lid originally had a bible verse inscribed on it based on Matthew 19:14

>Suffer the little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such belongeth the Kingdom of God. 

It has since been lost to weathering. After the death of their son, the Roberts family returned to Sydney in 1834.
