On the 4^th^ of March 1942, the auxiliary minesweeper *HMAS Tambar* was fired on by the Examination Battery at Fort Cowan Cowan on Moreton Island. There was a mix up in the identification code signal of the ship and the battery was ordered to fire across the bow of the unidentified vessel. The 6‑inch shell struck the ship’s forecastle killing [Able Seaman Archibald Bartsch](https://www.cwgc.org/find-records/find-war-dead/casualty-details/2242895/archibald-edward-bartsch/), a member of the anchor party, instantly. The shell skidded across the deck into the Captain’s cabin killing [Steward Eric Harrison](https://www.cwgc.org/find-records/find-war-dead/casualty-details/2242927/eric-ross-harrison/). It then passed through the radio room critically injuring [Warrant Officer Henry Theeman](https://www.cwgc.org/find-records/find-war-dead/casualty-details/2242980/henry-theeman/). Both of his legs were severed and his succumbed to his injuries soon after. Other crew received injuries to various degrees.

London‑born Theeman was aged 47. He had spent most of his life at sea. After three years in Moller Line ships travelling between Japan and China he left the line in August 1941 to join the RAN. Bartsch, son of 3^rd^ Light horseman William Henry Bartsch, was an employee if the Australasian United Paint Company of Port Augusta, South Australia prior to his enlistment in the navy. He was aged 20. Western Australian‑born Harrison was the son of William Ross and Rebecca Harrison. He was aged 33 and a resident of Melbourne.

The military covered up the incident so as not to affect morale. The newspapers widely reported the incident as an ‘[accident at sea](https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/50144174)’. The *Tambar’s* crew was dispersed throughout the RAN immediately after the men’s joint funeral two days later. The ship was temporarily paid off and the Captain given another command. The District Naval Officer (Commander E. C. Rhodes), other naval officers, and military representatives were present. The service was conducted by the Rev. H. H. Trigge of the Methodist Church and the Church of England’s Rev. F. R. C. Birch. Cannon and Cripps made the arrangements for the funeral and the cortege of Naval ratings from the Alice Street Depot marched from their funeral parlour.
