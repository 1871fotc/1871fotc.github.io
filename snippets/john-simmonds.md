<!-- ca. 1829 - 23-01-1889 -->

John Simmonds was born in Blandford, Dorset around 1828, the eldest son of John Simmonds, builder and stonemason and Ann (née Pond). John sailed with his family from London aboard the *Lady Eveline*, arriving in Port Phillip in November 1852. Mary Jemima Coombs married John at Pelham Street, Melbourne on 17 December 1859. They had 10 children born in Victoria. John took over the family’s stonemason business on the death of his father in 1860.

He created a fountain that was placed in the lawns immediately in front of the Queensland Houses of Parliament. In [*The Queenslander*, 9 December 1882](https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/19788278?searchTerm=Simmonds%20monumental%20mason) an article about the Brisbane Botanic Gardens, reported:

>A very pleasing and attractive addition has been made recently in the shape of a fountain, chaste and neat in its design rather than elaborate, but which, in the opinion of many, will not detract in the least from its usefulness or general effect. This addition is placed conspicuously on one of the lawns immediately in front of the Houses of Parliament, and when connected with the Enoggera main, and put into play, will have a very pleasing and salutary effect. This work of art — for such it may be termed — is the production of Mr. J. Simmonds, monumental mason and sculptor, of Adelaide street.

[The fountain was removed in 1958](https://www.jstor.org/stable/26391593) when the gardens were extensively redeveloped.

The business was founded in Melbourne in 1852 by John Simmonds Snr (1793-1860), then, after his death, passed on to his son John Simmonds Jnr (1828-1889).
