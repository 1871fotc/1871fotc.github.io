## Gunner: John Cornish Pentecost <small>(9‑29‑3)</small>

Born to John Pentecost and Susanna Cornish St Kevern, Cornwall on 3 June 1835. He served under his real name in the Royal Navy on *H.M.S. Acteen* and deserted from his ship in Rio de Janiero, Argentina. Taking a devious route he snuck back into England and boarded a ship that got him to America where he joined up to serve in the Northern navy in the American Civil War. One of seven men from that conflict buried in Toowong Cemetery.
