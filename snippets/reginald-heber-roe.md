## Reginald Heber Roe <small>(20‑25‑5A)</small>

Reginald was the first vice-chancellor of the University of Queensland, holding this position from 1910-1916. He was born on 3 August 1850 in Blandford Forum, Dorset, the youngest of 10 children to John Banister Roe Esq, a linen draper and button manufacturer turned wine merchant and Mary Ann née Allies, a school mistress at a school for young ladies. The family may hay fallen on hard times as Reginald was educated at Chris's Hospital, London, at that time a school for orphans and children of indigent gentleman. His father may have died in 1869 while Reginald was head boy at the school.

After graduating from Oxford, Reginald was appointed headmaster of Brisbane Grammar School in 1876, the youngest headmaster in Australia at that time. He established cadet training and encouraged sport for his students. In July 1909 he was appointed Inspector-General of Schools for Queensland and Inspector of Grammar Schools in 1917. He died in St Martin's Hospital, Brisbane on 21 September 1926.
