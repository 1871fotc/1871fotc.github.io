Eric Mark Margulies was the only doctor in the western Queensland country town of Cunnamulla. A major fire destroyed the hotel and the good doctor distinguished himself in the rescue, as well as in the treatment of the survivors, some of whom were very badly injured. Later he was the Government Medical Officer on the Gold Coast.
