On 22 November 1899 Bruce Wallace and his two sisters were swimming off a small sandbank in the Brisbane River at West End. The girls got into difficulties and Bruce was able to save one of the girls but trying to save himself and his other sister proved too exhausting and they were both drowned. Bruce was fourteen years old and his sister Ina was ten. The children usually went swimming with their father at the same spot, but on this day, their father had business in the city, so the children went swimming without him, with tragic consequences. They were the children of Andrew Stephen and Eva Sarah Wallace.

> His happy face is gone, his songs are hushed <br> 
> Here rests his head upon the lap of earth <br>
> In youth to fortune and to fame unknown. <br>

> Ina <br>
> Thou who here see beautiful and fair <br>
> That death should set in her glorious eyes. <br>
