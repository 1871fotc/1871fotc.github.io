## Edward Mott <small>(7‑44‑22)</small>

Edward Mott was born ca. 1807. He was convicted on the 18^th^ of January 1828 at Gloucester City Assizes for stealing a gun and was sentenced seven years transportation. He arrived in New South Wales on 8 September 1828 aboard the Countess of Harcourt. Edward was sent to Moreton Bay in June 1832 and his ticket‑of‑leave was issued on 9^th^ February 1844. 

Before 1859 he owned a large dairy on the land bounded by what is now George and Adelaide Streets. His cows watered at a big waterhole where City Hall now stands. After selling up, he moved to the sparsely settled Enoggera District. Late one August evening 1875, Edward was driving back from the city when he was dragged from his dray and his throat was slashed. He was left for dead and bore the scars for the rest of his life. No motive for the crime was ever discovered. 

Edward lived in Grovely for forty‑five years and after he died on the 28^th^ of August 1900, he was buried at St Matthew's Anglican churchyard in Grovely, but was moved to Toowong Cemetery in 1939. At the time of his death he was described as being in very comfortable circumstances.
