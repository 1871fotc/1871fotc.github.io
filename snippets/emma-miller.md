[Miller](https://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/miller-emma-7583) was born Emma Holmes in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, in June 1839. 

On 15 September 1857 at Chesterfield Register Office she married Jabez Mycroft Silcock, a bookkeeper with whom she had eloped. He died in 1870 leaving her with four small children to support. 
 

Emma was a gentlemen’s shirtmaker and she began to take in piecework, working twelve hours per day, six days per week. 

Emma remarried on 30 August 1874 at Salford, Lancashire, William Calderwood, a stonemason. They arrived in Brisbane in March 1879. He died just over a year later. Widowed again, Emma was forced to make her living by needlework. 

Emma was in the vanguard of the formation of women’s unions, the women’s suffrage movement, and the Labor Party. 

She actively supported strikers during the 1880s, and worked to alleviate the plight of the unemployed. 

Her third husband was Andrew Miller (d.1897), a widower whom she married at Brisbane Registry Office on 21 October 1886.

She campaigned tirelessly for freedom from conscription. Through these activities, she was known and admired throughout the country, and given the affectionate title ‘Mother of the Australian Labor Party’.

On 'Black Friday' of the 1912 strike, Emma led a large contingent of women to Parliament House, braving the batons of foot and mounted police. She reputedly stuck a hatpin into the horse of Police Commissioner Cahill who was thrown and injured. 

Emma died in 1917. On 22 October 1922 a publicly funded marble bust of her was unveiled in the Trades Hall.
