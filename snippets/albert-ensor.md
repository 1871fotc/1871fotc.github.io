## Albert Ensor <small>(20‑48‑5/6)</small>

Albert, his wife Clara and family arrived in Brisbane in June 1912. Albert, whose trade was house painter, was born in Birmingham on 5 December 1872 to John Robert Ensor and Emma Jane (née Robbins). In May 1917, at the age of 44years and 5 months, he enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force and trained as a machine gunner before eventually being deployed to France in August 1918. He stayed on in France after the Armistice to assist with the repatriation of soldiers. 

On his return to Brisbane, he resumed his previous occupation of house painter. Family lore has it that he was involved in doing interior plaster work and painting in the [Regent Theatre](https://apps.des.qld.gov.au/heritage-register/detail/?id=600140) in Queen Street which opened in 1919. Albert died on 5 May 1950 at the age of 77.
