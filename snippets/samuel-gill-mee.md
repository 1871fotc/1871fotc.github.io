## Samuel Gill Mee <small>(4‑12‑30)</small> 

Samuel was born in Wellingborough, Northamptonshire in 1819 where he learned his trade as a compositor. He arrived in Sydney in September 1852. He was seized with gold fever but soon found he was unsuited for life as a gold digger. He returned to the newspaper trade in Bathurst and Sydney, followed by a stint as a shepherd on a station property. 

Samuel then came to Brisbane where he obtained employment as a compositor with the Brisbane Newspaper Company in 1860 and remained for nearly fifty years until his death on 9 November 1909 aged 90 years. As well as being a compositor, many essays, poems and sketches from his pen were published in the *Courier* and *Queenslander*, including one published in the  *Brisbane Courier* following the death of Governor Blackall.
