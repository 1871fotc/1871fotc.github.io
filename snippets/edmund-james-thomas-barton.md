## Edmund James Thomas Barton <small>(11‑24‑16)</small>

Edmund Barton was born in Chelsea England in 1854 and came to Queensland with his parents in 1862. In 1868 he entered the service of the Brisbane Newspaper Co Ltd as an apprentice compositor on both the *Brisbane Courier* and *Queenslander* but seven years later, shortly after completing his indenture, he transferred to the literary staff where his ability as a shorthand writer brought him speedy recognition. With Mr W J Morley, he was responsible for the *Courier's* Parliamentary reports. 

In April 1903 following the resignation of the editor-in-chief, Edmund was promoted to the *Courier's* editorial chair. He occupied that position until his resignation in May 1906. He continued his literary work for many years, editing, among other publications, the *Queensland Sugar Journal* for 26 years. He died on 10 April 1937 at the age of 83 years.
