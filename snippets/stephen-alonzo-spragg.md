## Stephen Alonzo Spragg <small>(5‑15‑26)</small>

"Lonnie" or "Lonzie" Spragg was born on 2 October 1879 at Redfern, Sydney. His elusiveness and goal-kicking prowess won him a place in Australia's first full international Rugby Union team against Great Britain in Sydney on 24 June 1899. In January 1900 he moved to Rockhampton and then to Brisbane where he settled in May 1900. He helped Queensland to five successive wins over NSW in Brisbane. In twenty-one international and interstate matches he scored 104 points. He was also prominent in rowing, cricket and table tennis. 

He died from peritonitis following an appendectomy in Brisbane General Hospital on 12 February 1904. On 24 July 1904 a monument over his grave was unveiled by the then-president of the Queensland Rugby Union.
