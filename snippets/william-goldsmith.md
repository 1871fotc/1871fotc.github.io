## William Goldsmith <small>[(10‑84‑22)](https://brisbane.discovereverafter.com/profile/31827081 "Go to Memorial Information" )</small>

Born in England William worked as a labourer prior to enlisting. A sapper in the tunnellers, William joined aged 31 in Feb 1917 and he was married with 3 children.

He fought for almost a year before being discharged in early 1918 due to hernia.

William died by drinking Lysol poison in 1942 at the age of 58. Now will get an official war grave as his death was recently deemed to be due to his war service. 

==I will read some extracts from an email I got from his great granddaughter.==
