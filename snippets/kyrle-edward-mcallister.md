## Kyrle Edward McAllister (Sylvaney) <small>(23‑31‑15)</small>

English‑born Arthur was a tenor who was a regular fixture on the Melbourne stage. Arthur was 57 when he died on 3 November 1929 in a motor accident together with variety artist Kyrle Sylvaney who was aged 33. Their headstone was erected as a token of affection by their friends and admirers. 

He was born in 1873 in Walsall, Staffordshire. He was a saddlemaker and the story goes that his workmates heard him singing and said that if they could sing like that then they would never work again. He decided to try his fame and fortune by going to London and performing at the music halls The Pavilion and The Palace. 

He was discovered by William Morris who suggested he go with him to New York. His wife did not want to go, but he went regardless! He sang Shubert‑Brady revivals on Broadway where he played many leading roles until 1915. He was with J. C. Williamson’s company and toured Australia. He came to Australia with Nell Flemming and played in The Follies. 

The National Library of Australia has a collection of sheet music dedicated to him.
