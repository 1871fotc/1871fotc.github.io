## Karoly (Charles) Pulszky <small>(5‑2‑3)</small>

Charles was born in London on 10 November 1854, the son of politician and revolutionary Ferenc Pulsky, a member of a prominent Hungarian family. He was an urbane art collector who founded the Budapest Museum of Fine Arts. He married famous Ibsen‑exponent, actress Emilia Márkus. 

Implicated in a politically‑motivated financial scandal, he went into a lonely exile after a trial in 1896. He shot himself at Myrltetown on 5 June 1899 having been in Queensland for about two months working as an AMP canvasser. In 1913, while on a tour to South America, the world‑famous ballet dancer Vaslav Nijinsky impulsively married his daughter, Romola Pulsky, who had pursued him throughout Europe. The White Stag of Exile was written about his life by Thomas Shapcott in 1984.
