## John Daniel Heal <small>(13‑40‑9)</small>

John Daniel Heal was born near Bradford‑on‑Avon, England on 18 January 1825. He was the son of Ambrose Heal, mason and Elizabeth Smith. He emigrated from England to Brisbane in mid 1856. He married at least twice and had at least eight children, many of whom died in childhood. In Brisbane, John Heal worked at his trade as a stone mason. 

In 1863, he leased the [Prince Consort Hotel](https://apps.des.qld.gov.au/heritage-register/detail/?id=600212) in Wickham Street, Fortitude Valley and became a publican. He bought the hotel in 1879 and by 1887 had acquired a number of adjoining properties. In 1887—1888, Heal tore down the old hotel and had a larger hotel erected, which was designed by Richard Gailey. 

He was very involved in community affairs and was a great advocate for the progress of Fortitude Valley. In 1870 he was elected to the Brisbane Council as an Alderman for the Fortitude Valley Ward. He served his electorate in this role from 1870 to 1873, losing in 1874. However, the following year, he won the ward of Fortitude Valley back and held it until 1894, after which he did not seek re‑election. He was Mayor in 1879. He died in Brisbane on 18 August 1908.
