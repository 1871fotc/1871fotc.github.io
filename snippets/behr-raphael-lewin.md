## Behr Raphael Lewin <small>(3‑8‑10/11)</small>

About 1875 he carried a "Sepher Torah" (i.e. a Scroll of the Old Testament) on horse‑back up the mountain range ‑ the Toll Bar Road ‑ to Toowoomba in order to install Jewish Religious services there. The Toowoomba Synagogue was actually consecrated some years before the Brisbane Synagogue, though the Brisbane Hebrew Congregation was formed in 1865. Mr Levin was an official of both Congregations.
