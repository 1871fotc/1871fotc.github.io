When he returned home, the repatriation department wrote to his previous employer trying to get him employed back on the trams. He worked there for around 12 months before he left. 

He married in 1919 after coming back to Adelaide and had two children, one died as a baby. He was the support person for his mother.  He was allocated a block of land in 1922. After marital problems he separated from his wife who wrote when she applied for a widow’s pension, which was knocked back, 

>“I was married to Herbert Haines in 1919 after his return from service and at that time he suffered from rheumatism. Immediately after our marriage he seemed very peculiar – would sit for long periods without speaking and avoided company. He would sometimes not converse with me for days.

>About 1925 he began to wander away from home and was absent on occasions for about 3 weeks, at the end of which time he returned home and did not appear to know where he had been. From 1927 he did practically no work on the farm and in 1928 he gave it up and the farm was repossessed – he left me and I did not see him again. 

Herbert ended up in Queensland and spent some time in Toowoomba. He developed mental problems and died penniless in prison from heart failure after he stole watch and got 2 months jail. Herbert died in 1934 from a heart attack at the age of 43. 

Henry is getting an official war grave as he was a prisoner of war so it’s automatic.
