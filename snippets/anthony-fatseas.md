## Anthony Fatseas <small>(18‑191‑13E)</small> 

<!-- 1909‑1961 -->

The grave of husband and wife, Anthony and Catherine Fatseas is highlighted during this walk for his burial in what looks like a small Greek Mausoleum, the same shape and colour of the chapels found in the Greek Islands. While it looks like a mausoleum, those buried here are underground rather than within the mausoleum walls.  

Anthony Fatseas was born in Smyrna in Turkey in 1909. He finished elementary school in Turkey and moved to Athens, Greece with his parents and studied at the French School there. He completed his compulsory military service translating French and became an accountant, later moving to Egypt.  He arrived in Australia in 1947 and worked for a year on the editorial staff of an ethnic newspaper and then worked in cafes and as a clerk. Finally, he became a partner in a delicatessen business.
