## Ataman Vladimir Tolstoff <small>(8‑64‑8)</small> 

<!-- 1882‑1956 -->
 
Members of the Russian community had often looked to Australia as a place of safety during times of economic and political revolution. The revolution in 1917, however brought cause for concern when it was thought more radical refugees were arriving. This caused the Australian Government to declare an embargo on Russian emigrants from 1917‑1922. When this embargo was lifted in 1922 it gave rise to one of the largest influxes of Russians into Queensland, their population increasing to approximately 3000 by the late 1930s.

One of them was Ataman (General) Vladimir Tolstoff, Commander of the 4^th^ Ural Cossacks during the revolution. After suffering numerous defeats at the hand of the Bolshevik forces, General Tolstoff lead what remained of his regiment and their families out of Russia and south to Persia by camel and horseback through Kazakhstan and Turkmenia, eventually fleeing across the border into China. Pooling their money, the General arranged for the purchase of a block of farmland in Thornlands, just outside Brisbane and in November 1923 he brought 57 Ural Cossacks, together with other men, women and children with him to Brisbane. The Russian community settled across Queensland during this time working on cotton and dairy farms and even the mines in Mount Isa. Some of the descendants of the group led by General Tolstoff still remain farming vegetables, strawberries and flowers in Ormiston and Cleveland today.   

As a result of the work of immigrants like those led by General Tolstoff, it is believed more than 10,000 people of Russian descent are currently living in Queensland making valuable contributions to the state. This is further evidenced around Toowong Cemetery where you can see many graves painted with Russian blue containing Cossacks from the Revolution.
