## Dr John Henry Griffin <small>(2A‑23‑5)</small>

Irish-born, Dr Griffin was the son of John Griffin, a leading Dublin broker, and Florence (née McCooke). After qualifying in multiple fields of medicine in Brussels, London and Ireland, he arrived in Brisbane ca. 1889 and soon became well known for his professional skill and his general popularity. 

Soon after his arrival, he joined the [Brisbane Hunt Club](https://www.slq.qld.gov.au/blog/brisbane-hunt-club) which had been started in 1888 by Adolph Feez. On 1 July 1893 he was killed during a hunt when his horse struck the top rail of a fence, throwing the 30-year-old doctor over the fence and landing heavily on his head. Death was instantaneous.
