## Lieutenant John Higson <small>(2A‑31‑16)</small>

[Higson](https://www.awm.gov.au/collection/R1446575) went to the Boer War with the 4^th^ Contingent. Prior to embarkation, he had been a school teacher at South Brisbane. While on service, Higson was shot through the head. After regaining consciousness, he was helped off the battlefield and eventually returned to Queensland little worse for wear. After recuperating, he returned to South Africa, intending to return to the conflict just as the contingent was ordered back. He returned to teaching and was active in musical and masonic activities. 

His death on the 13 November 1902 aged 38 was unexpected. He was afforded a military funeral. The coffin, covered by the Union Jack, left his residence at Taringa on a gun carriage. At the corner of Jephson Street and Sylvan Road, a military cortege consisting of soldiers, sailors, band and firing party from the South Brisbane State School joined in the procession to the cemetery.
