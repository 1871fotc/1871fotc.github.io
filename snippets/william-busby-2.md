## William Busby <small>(4‑3‑22)</small>

William and his wife Annie departed Plymouth aboard the *Mhari Bhan* on 29 August 1882 and [arrived in Brisbane 29 November 1882](http://www.dragongenealogy.com/blog/2011/11/tombstone-tuesday-william-busby-stonemason-of-toowong/). William worked as an Inspector of Works until he [controversially lost his job for using obscene language](https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/3521969?searchTerm=INSPECTOR%20Busby). 

William established himself as a stonemason and had a workshop and home in Cemetery Road (now Sylvan Road), Toowong, and a quarry at Goodna. Notable works in Toowong Cemetery include:

- the heritage-listed Caskey Monument. [William won the competition](https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/19130745) to design a memorial to the late Lieutenant Caskey and it is the first known South African War memorial in Queensland. 
- a memorial to [Mr. Percy Lionel Benjamin](https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/19244847) erected by the
directors of Messrs. Hoffnung and Co. At the time the marble obelisk was said to be the largest piece of marble cut in Queensland.
- a memorial to [Stephen Alonzo Spragg](https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/19278904), a member of Australia's first full International Rugby Union team.
