## George Fish <small>(12‑1‑11)</small>

The Brisbane Steam Laundry at South Brisbane first opened in January 1881 but was taken over by George Fish two years later. The laundry was situated in an alley extending from Stanley to Grey Street. The alley became known as Soda Water Lane. Despite hardships, the business expanded under his ownership. After repairs from damage during the 1893 floods, the laundry reopened with a new name, Fish Stream Laundry. George entered local government politics in 1894. Fish Stream Laundry moved to Ann Street, Fortitude Valley in 1902. Soda Water Lane was renamed [Fish Lane](https://explorefishlane.com.au) in 1904. George died on 23 September 1925, aged 74.
