Born Pallasgreen, near Limerick Ireland on 17 March 1846 or 1847 to James Real and Ellen Donegan. The family migrated to Moreton Bay on the typhus-plagued voyage of the *Emigrant* in 1850 with his father dying from the disease. Young Patrick left school at the age of 12 to commence a carpentry apprenticeship to support his family and was employed at the Ipswich railway workshops before leaving his trade at the age of 22 to study law. Following a distinguished career as a barrister, he was appointed a judge of the Supreme Court of Queensland in 1890 and Senior Puisne Judge in 1903. He died at his home *Eulalia* at Norman Park on 10 June 1928.
