## Elizabeth Dale <small>(1‑148‑29)</small>

Prior to 1905, the creek which runs through the Cemetery had been dammed to provide water for flowers and grapes which were grown in Portion 10 and sold to Cemetery visitors. Taps were being installed but before the dam could be emptied it claimed the life of Elizabeth Dale. 

On 31 January 1905, on the anniversary of her husband's death, Elizabeth left her Rosalie home with the intention of going to Wynnum for a few days. On the way, she planned to visit her husband's and brother's graves. The next day she was [found drowned](https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/19360320) in [the Cemetery's dam](http://www.oncewasacreek.org/2014/08/up-hill-and-down-dale-where-did-elizabeth-drown/). 

The inquest noted that Elizabeth was in delicate health, short-sighted and prone to fainting fits. The government analyst found a [trace of morphine](https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/19335877) in her system, which was not surprising as Elizabeth was in the habit of taking Kay's Compound, the key ingredient of which was morphine[^1].
