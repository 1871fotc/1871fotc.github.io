Sidney enlisted age 21 in 1914 in Sydney where he lived with his father who was widowed prior to coming to Australia from England. He became acting sergeant. He was later appointed 2nd lieutenant in France and transferred to the 4^th^ battalion. In 1917 it was written on his service record ‘The army cor commander wishes to express his appreciation of the gallant service rendered by Sidney Dutton during the recent operations.”
 
Sidney fought for the army for 5 long years before being discharged. 

When Sidney Dutton returned home from the war, he was granted some farming land at Beerburrum similar to other soldiers as part of a resettlement program. The problem was a lot of soldiers had no experience farming plus the small allotments they were given often could not support any viable crop. Sidney came to Brisbane on and off looking for work but he was unable to find work. He died aged 31, in 1924, by suicide in Lang Park. The Trove articles about his death said as follows - 

Trove article 18 Jan 1924

>OUT OF WORK. WORRIED MAN'S SUICIDE.

>In, the Inquiry Court yesterday afternoon, Mr, J, Burrows, J.P., ' continued the inquiry into the circumstances of the death of Sidney Dutton, whose dead body was found in Lang Park, with a bullet through his heart.
John Hugh Langdon; at present residing at Burleigh Heads, gave evidence to the effect that he saw deceased in Queen Street, opposite the "Telegraph" Newspaper Company, about -4.30 p.m. the afternoon prior to his death. Deceased appeared to be worried about being out of work.

>Constable William Henry Ridgway stated that he made Inquiries regarding the deceased, and found deceased owned a 32. calibre rifle, while at the Anzac Club. Witness could not get any trace of the rifle from them until it was found alongside deceased in Lang Park. It was possible to dismantle the rifle and wrap it up in paper, and carry it about without being seen. Possibly deceased did this. Witness was of opinion that deceased took his own life. Witness had been unable to get any information of anyone owing deceased any money. Harry Boyd Cuton, manager of the New Motor-car Coy., residing at Auchenflower, stated time he was acquainted with deceased for some years, and he always called at witness's home when he came in from Beerburrum. Witness often saw him at his office. The day before his death deceased called at about 5 p.m., and in the course of conversation deceased stated that he was out of work.
Witness informed him there was always a home and three meals a day for him at his place. He left witness about 10.15 p.m., and said "Cheer, oh! I will see you again”. Witness went in direction of George Street. The parcel deceased was carrying did not appear to be a rifle. Witness knows of no one who owed deceased money, in fact, witness did not think deceased owned £5 for the last nine months. If he had lent anyone money it must have been previous to that. Deceased owned a block of land at Bulimba, and 10 shares in the Beerburrum Co-operative Coy. Witness made all arrangements for the burial of deceased. The inquiry was closed.”

Another Trove article titled “A debtor who waved him on” said that a witness said that Dutton told him there was a man that owed him 5 pounds but would not pay him. A lady who owned a boarding house in Red Hill said Dutton came to live in her boarding house a couple of months earlier. She said Dutton had a lively disposition.
