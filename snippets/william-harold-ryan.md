## William Harold Ryan <small>(7A‑116‑44)</small>  

1873 ‑ 1954

Ryan started his career as Constable in 1893 and ended it as Commissioner in 1934. He saw service the length and breadth of Queensland. He was awarded the Royal Humane Society’s Medal for rescuing a party of women from drowning in the Sarina Inlet in 1901. The following year he was seriously injured on duty in Ravenswood when three men came to the rescue of their mate who Ryan was arresting and beat him senseless. He was eventually transferred to Brisbane when promoted to Senior Inspector in 1921 and became Commissioner in 1925. Soon afterwards, as a means of reducing crime in the suburbs, Ryan introduced bicycle patrols. He also sanctioned the recruitment of the first policewomen, who were stationed at Roma Street in 1931. Ryan died as a result of injuries received when he was struck by a taxi outside his home on Sherwood Road, Toowong on 16 July 1954. He was 81.
