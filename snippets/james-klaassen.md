## James Klaassen <small>(7A‑138‑21/22)</small>

<!-- circa 1873 - 13 March 1925 -->

What have sailing and managing a pub in common? Plenty, if the pub is the Regatta Hotel on the banks of the Brisbane River. James Klaassen owned and was managing the Regatta Hotel, Coronation Drive, Toowong at the time of his death. He won the A.F. Reid Trophy for sailing in Iris, 1916-17. His four sons were enthusiastic and successful participants in the rowing regattas raced on the stretch of Brisbane River in front of his hotel.

James had previously owned a hotel on the site of the present day Mater Mothers' Hospital. He sold this to the Mater and then purchased the famous wrought-iron river landmark, the Regatta Hotel. He also owned a cattle property at Goondiwindi and had his own racing colours.

With an Irish mother and a Danish father, Brisbane-born James Klaassen was associated with the Queensland Irish Association. He was married to Margaret Booker, the eldest daughter of Maryborough pioneer pastoralist, Charles Edward Sydney Booker. James Klaassen died suddenly of heart failure at his home, *Ellerslie*, Gray Road, Hill End, Brisbane on the 13^th^ of March 1925 leaving a widow and four sons.
